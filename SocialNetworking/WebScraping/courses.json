It is now being offered globally as one of Peking Universityâs MOOCs. \n\nAddressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing studentsâ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding studentsâ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",

For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels â coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important â and sometimes conflicting â drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earthâs environments. \n\nIn this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (ârealitiesâ) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.",

We quickly make connections drawn from our own lives and can fill in other aspects in a story like meaning, emotion, narrative trajectory and so on.\n\nAs the listener, itâs relatively easy to hear a story and imagine, empathize and even come up with possible solutions to alleviate pain. But not so easy when you are the providerâand part of the story itself. Why is that? Why can we do it from a distance, but itâs so difficult to see when we are one of the people in the story?

But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.In this Ableton Certified Training Center course developed by Berklee Online, you will explore some of Liveâs most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not own Ableton Live 10, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30 days. If you use the trial version, do not download it until the course is scheduled to begin.",

We will focus on the prolific and exciting overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent social movements around the world. Rather than assess the political efficacy of activities like mourning, listening, organizing, dancing, or partying, the lectures examine such cultural activities next to, and within, contemporary art practice.Included in the course are guest presentations by key artists, activists, and scholars, like: Rebecca Gomperts, Chido Govera, Gulf Labor, Hans Haacke, Sharon Hayes, Jolene Rickard, Gregory Sholette, Joshua Wong, and many more. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch and co-taught by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, the course challenges learners to treat the MOOC itself as a social and artistic form. This happens mostly through the practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback.\n\nWhile no prior art making or activist experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.\n\nFor other course offerings or language versions in this series, just search 'ART of the MOOC' inside the Coursera course catalogue.",

    "content": "Sports have become an ever-present reflection of American culture, and an important symbol of the divisions and alliances in our society. Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports.How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space â or doesn't â for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they \"shut up and dribble\"? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. \n\nYour professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today.",

It assumes you have completed the prior courses on \"Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices\" and \"Analytical Mechanics for Spacecraft Dynamics\".  This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.\n\nNext, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy â M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firmâs long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:\n\n1.Executive Summary: \nThis 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.\n\n2. Student Level:\nThis level involves an understanding of the technical details.  This level requires basic knowledge of concepts in corporate finance, e.g., the time value of money, financial statement analysis, capital structure, and the relation between risk and returns. Learners of this level can skip week 1.\n\n3. Honors Level (honors certificate): \nThis level is challenging, engaging, and compelling to an intellectually rigorous student.",

The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.\n\nToday, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory.

There are classes that teach these Agentic AI concepts, but they are geared towards programmers. If you aren't a programmer, they won't teach you how to build agents to help with your daily tasks.This class will teach you how to use ChatGPT and Zapier to build your own agents to help prioritize tasks, keep track of expenses, plan meals and shopping lists, etc. These won't be tools that require you to cut and paste the results back into an email; these will be tools that can directly create a draft email and put it into your email account or allow you to snap a picture of a receipt on the go and have it show up in a spreadsheet. These agents can automate and take action for you.\n\nBy the end of this class, not only will you understand state-of-the-art aspects of Agentic AI, but you will have built your own Travel Expense Agent. Your agent will be able to take a picture of a receipt or a description of an expense and catalog it into a Google Sheet. It will check your expense with another agent for completeness, ensure the expense isn't already in the spreadsheet, and even draft an email to your administrator with a simple reimbursement report.\n\nThis course will transform the way you work.",

    "content": "Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges is a four-week course that explores ethical and societal aspects of the increasing use of artificial intelligent technologies (AI). The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society.The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.\n\nIn the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? \n\nNext, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.\n\nA further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by âconsciousâ? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. \n\nIn the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? \n\nThe last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, \nÂ·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts âintelligenceâ and âconsciousnessâ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness, \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the concepts of âforward-lookingâ and âbackward-looking responsibilityâ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI, \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem, \nÂ·      and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues.",

An in-depth understanding of key components and design principles is crucial for professionals working in the field. This comprehensive overview aims to delve into the essential aspects of HVAC, covering high side and low side equipment, air handling units, chiller and cooling tower systems, chilled water pumping systems, piping and duct design, as well as external static pressure and insulation.High side equipment plays a pivotal role in the HVAC system, focusing on the heat absorption and rejection process. Chillers, the cornerstone of this system, utilize different mechanisms such as absorption, centrifugal, or reciprocating, tailoring their operation to specific requirements. Complementing chillers are cooling towers, which dissipate heat from the system, ensuring optimal efficiency. Understanding the classifications and components of these systems is fundamental to their effective integration into HVAC designs.\nOn the other hand, low side equipment involves air distribution and regulation. Air Handling Units (AHUs) are central to this function, ensuring the circulation and conditioning of air within a controlled environment. The classification of AHUs, such as single-zone, dual-zone, or multi-zone, provides flexibility in meeting diverse spatial requirements. Fan Coil Units (FCUs) further refine air temperature control, considering mounting types like horizontal, vertical, or ceiling-mounted units.\nChillers, with their ability to cool water or other fluids, are critical for temperature regulation in HVAC systems. Understanding their classifications based on mechanism and their interplay with cooling towers enhances system efficiency. Cooling towers, categorized as natural draft, forced draft, or induced draft, contribute to the heat dissipation process, optimizing overall performance.\nAHUs regulate and circulate air, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment. Understanding their major components â filters, coils, humidifiers, fans, dampers, and controls â is essential for effective design and operation. Classification based on airflow and configuration, along with considerations for specific applications, provides a holistic understanding of AHUs.\nThis system involves the circulation of chilled water through chillers, pumps, piping, and terminal units. Different distribution schemes, such as Constant Primary Flow or Primary Variable Flow, dictate water distribution. Important terminologies like static head, dynamic head, and Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) are vital for efficient system design and operation.\nEfficient transport of fluids and air is facilitated through well-designed piping and duct systems. Understanding chilled water pipe sizing, duct sizing methods, and considerations for fittings and accessories ensures optimal system performance. Duct construction materials, insulation, and support systems are critical factors in achieving energy-efficient HVAC designs.\nExternal static pressure is a key parameter influencing the airflow and efficiency of HVAC systems. Proper understanding and management of this pressure are essential for maintaining optimal conditions. Insulation principles, encompassing heat transfer fundamentals and material selection, play a crucial role in mitigating energy losses and ensuring system efficiency.\nIn conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of these HVAC components and systems is imperative for professionals in the field. From the high side and low side equipment to the intricacies of air handling units, pumping systems, and piping and duct design, a holistic approach ensures the successful design, installation, and maintenance of efficient HVAC systems tailored to diverse environmental needs.

Para poder aplicar estas ecuaciones para resolver problemas, es necesario manipularlas  siguiendo ciertas reglas que nos da el Ã¡lgebra.\n    Piensa en el Ã¡lgebra como la gramÃ¡tica, que nos dice cÃ³mo traducir nuestras ideas al lenguaje, cÃ³mo formar frases y oraciones a partir de palabras, cÃ³mo conjugar verbos, a identificar las partes de una oraciÃ³n, las reglas de acentuaciÃ³n, etcÃ©tera.\n    En este curso, ofrecido por la UNAM, aprenderÃ¡s a construir expresiones algebraicas a partir de frases, lo que te permitirÃ¡ resolver problemas en los que  conoces algunos datos numÃ©ricos y necesitas encontrar otros.\n    PodrÃ¡s plantear y resolver ecuaciones de primer grado, ecuaciones simultÃ¡neas y ecuaciones de segundo grado.\n    Este curso te va a ser muy Ãºtil si actualmente estas llevando un curso de Ã¡lgebra en la escuela y tienes problemas con Ã©l. TambiÃ©n si ya has estudiado Ã¡lgebra y necesitas repasarla, ya que necesitas recordarla para tener Ã©xito en otros cursos mÃ¡s avanzados, como GeometrÃ­a AnalÃ­tica, CÃ¡lculo o EstadÃ­stica.",

Y esta es la parte que casi iguala la capacidad de nuestro cerebro de poder decidir de forma casi instantÃ¡nea y ponderar todas las variables involucradas en la toma de una decisiÃ³n que puede ser de vida o muerte.\n\nCada vez que manejamos sometemos a nuestro cerebro a un continuo anÃ¡lisis multivariado que pondera variables como la velocidad, las condiciones del clima, del camino, las distracciones internas y externas o los imprevistos que pudiÃ©ramos encontrar. Esto es lo que hacemos en el anÃ¡lisis multivariado, considerar muchas variables, discriminarlas, agruparlas, relacionarlas y conformar grupos de datos.\n\nA lo largo de este curso, aprenderÃ¡s las principales tÃ©cnicas del anÃ¡lisis multivariante empleando R y R studio como herramienta de anÃ¡lisis, graficaciÃ³n y toma de decisiones. El software R de anÃ¡lisis estadÃ­stico y la plataforma de desarrollo R studio poseen la gran ventaja de ser de uso libre, con una gran comunidad de programadores que la enriquecen con librerÃ­as que hacen su uso sencillo y extremadamente poderoso.\n\nEn este curso, ademÃ¡s de aprender los fundamentos de R y R studio, aplicaremos las tÃ©cnicas de anÃ¡lisis multivariado como: componentes principales, anÃ¡lisis de clÃºsteres y anÃ¡lisis discriminante en la soluciÃ³n de problemas y casos empresariales. No necesitas experiencia previa en programaciÃ³n solo conocimientos bÃ¡sicos de estadÃ­stica, te guiaremos paso a paso en el uso de de estas herramientas y su aplicaciÃ³n.",

It assumes you have a strong foundation in spacecraft dynamics and control, including particle dynamics, rotating frame, rigid body kinematics and kinetics.  The focus of the course is to understand key analytical mechanics methodologies to develop equations of motion in an algebraically efficient manner.  The course starts by first developing DâAlembertâs principle and how the associated virtual work and virtual displacement concepts allows us to ignore non-working force terms.  Unconstrained systems and holonomic constrains are investigated.  Next Kane's equations and the virtual power form of D'Alembert's equations are briefly reviewed for particles.Next Lagrangeâs equations are developed which still assume a finite set of generalized coordinates, but can be applied to multiple rigid bodies as well.  Lagrange multipliers are employed to apply Pfaffian constraints.  \n\nFinally, Hamiltonâs extended principle is developed to allow us to consider a dynamical system with flexible components.  Here there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom.  The course focuses on how to develop spacecraft related partial differential equations, but does not study numerically solving them.  The course ends comparing the presented assumed mode methods to classical final element solutions.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

You will gain first-hand experience of this by analyzing how animals are represented in the media. Modules 2 and 3 investigate human-animal relationships, including those that involve suffering as well as those that are beneficial. Although many people describe their pets as friends or family members, Module 2 takes a deeper dive into what constitutes friendship and family membership where other species are concerned. Module 3 examines the dark side of these relationships, focusing on animal abuse and its relationship to domestic violence. Module 4 focuses on peopleâs encounters with those animals outside the boundaries of the home and the farm. The way people understand and regard the species commonly considered âwildâ shapes the treatment and moral status of these animals.",

If you wish to receive credit for your participation in the course, you will need to complete the full course on the SCCME website at: http://cme.stanford.edu/online. The course version on Coursera does not offer CME credit.\n\nCourse Description\nAntibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence â inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level.",

Anti-Racism II takes on the vital role assisting students in guiding their own conversations regarding race, and additionally gender and sexuality. Anti-Racism II will expand your knowledge and critically engage your inquiry, centering upon short interviews with leading scholars and activists in the field.   Coupled with supplementary video and reading material, these interviews will further demonstrate the power of open dialogue and self-narration, directing you towards being an anti-racist ally. The centrality of the course interviews will culminate in a final project where students will construct and carry out their own personalized interview. The final project will test dialogic skills while asserting the importance of intimate conversations about race, gender, and sexuality. \n\nThis is challenging work in troubling times that may conjure uneasy feelings and emotions. Anti-Racism II can work as a bridge coming face to face with your personal individual relationship with social demands plaguing us nationally and globally.

By the end of this course, you will feel more confident and capable of implementing rigorous statistical analyses in your career as a data analyst! \n\nIn the first module, youâll explore the essential building blocks of statistics that enable rigorous data analysis. By the end, youâll be able to define populations, samples, and sampling methods; characterize datasets using measures of central tendency, variability, and skewness; use correlation to understand relationships between features; and employ segmentation to reveal insights about different groups within your data. Youâll apply these concepts to real-world scenarios: analyzing movie ratings and durations over time, explaining customer behavior, and exploring healthcare outcomes.\n\nIn the second module, youâll cover key probability rules and concepts like conditional probability and independence, all with real-world examples youâll encounter as a data analyst. Then youâll explore probability distributions, both discrete and continuous. You'll learn about important distributions like the binomial and normal distributions, and how they model real-world phenomena. Youâll also see how you can use sample data to understand the distribution of your population, and how to answer common business questions like how common are certain outcomes or ranges of outcomes? Finally, youâll get hands on with simulation techniques. You'll see how to generate random data following specific distributions, allowing you to model complex scenarios and inform decision-making.\n\nIn modules 3 and 4, you'll learn powerful techniques to draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. This is your first foray into inferential statistics. Youâll start by constructing confidence intervals - a way to estimate population parameters like means and proportions with a measure of certainty. You'll learn how to construct and interpret these intervals for both means and proportions. Youâll also visualize how this powerful technique helps you manage the inherent uncertainty when investigating many business questions. Next, youâll conduct hypothesis testing, a cornerstone of statistical inference that helps you determine whether an observed difference reflects random variation or a true difference. You'll discover how to formulate hypotheses, calculate test statistics, and interpret p-values to make data-driven decisions. Youâll learn tests for means and proportions, as well as how to compare two samples.\n\nThroughout the course, youâll use large language models as a thought partner for descriptive and inferential statistics.

The first course covered generalities on the international courts and tribunals in The Hague, while the second course provided an insider's  perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  This third course explores the major aspects of international arbitration as one of the most common method of international dispute settlement . Through this course you will gain an in-depth understanding of the  various facets of international arbitration through the analysis of its role as a mechanism of dispute settlement, its institutions, the fields of law it is applicable to, and, of course, its most famous awards.The main question we will answer together during this course is \"Can international arbitration contribute to the creation of a peaceful world through the settlement of disputes between States and between States and non-State actors?\" In order to do so, we will learn the basic historical concepts or arbitration, as well as everything there is to know about the Permanent Court of Arbitration, based in The Hague. We will then dive into the role of international arbitration in settling disputes relating to the Law of the Sea, with a particular insight into the landmark South China Sea Arbitration. For an entire module, we will focus on investment arbitration, its principles and the procedure of the ICSID, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. We will conclude the course with a module on the interplay between state immunity and enforcement of arbitral awards. This is brought to light through the Yukos Arbitration which is a perfect illustration of the topic.\n\nThis course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into international arbitration, its role and the current issues relating to it. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the principles and rules of arbitration. You will explore the topic through concrete examples and the most prominent arbitrations. You will also grasp the notion of international arbitration navigating between law and politics. International arbitration and The Hague go hand in hand: several key arbitration institutes are located in The Hague and important disputes were settled here through arbitration. The Hague is, so to speak, âthe place to be for international arbitrationâ, especially when we are dealing with arbitration between States, or arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and States. \n\nJoin us for the course and become an expert on international arbitration!\n\nThis course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option. If you want a certificate, but are unable to pay for it, you can request financial aid via Coursera.",

    "content": "What is philosophy?  How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical questionââHow shall I live?ââand his pupil, Plato, and Platoâs pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.",

Over the past decades, a new figure has emerged that of the art manager.Imagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.\n\t\nThis course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. \n\nLearning Objectives\nThere are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with aÂ quizÂ and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums:Â www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano:Â \nwww.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano):Â eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia):Â www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust:Â www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum:Â www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org/en/list/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence):Â www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino:Â www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles.",

    "content": "More than two decades into the new millennium, it is difficult to envision a future in which digital technologies do not play a significant role. Digital technologies frequently make a lot of promises. However, in recent years, we have seen an increasing number of artists address fundamental issues of the Digital Transformation, such as surveillance, lack of representation, and digital illiteracy. Artists have demonstrated that, while digital technologies have the potential to support processes leading to greater equality, they are frequently viewed as perpetuating and even exacerbating inequalities.This course is primarily aimed at changemakers who want to build a better digital future with the help of the arts.\n\nThis course will teach you how the arts can influence technology development through art and enterprise collaborations; how the arts can assist citizens and civil society in making sense of and overcoming the challenges brought on by the Digital Transformation; and how the arts can influence the processes of regulation, policy-making, and legislation within the Digital Transformation. The course also provides insights into arts organisation, reflecting on issues of funding and community building that many engaged artists face. Building on theoretical concepts, questions about the arts and technology will be elaborated and explored through conversations with brilliant artists, makers, curators, and others working at the intersection of the arts and technology, who will generously share their knowledge and experiences with us.\n\nIf you are an artist or an organisation interested in learning more about the power of the arts to influence digital transformation, this is the place to start. This course will provide you with the foundation and inspiration to begin or continue work on investigating, promoting, and facilitating more equal, inclusive, and democratic digital futures. It will provide you with an understanding of the challenges and opportunities of the Digital Transformation, as well as concrete ideas for how the arts can help.",

    "content": "For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning.

Therefore, it is essential for data scientists to develop the skills in producing and critically interpreting digital maps, charts, and graphs. Data visualization is an increasingly important topic in our globalized and digital society. It involves graphically representing data or information, enabling decision-makers across various industries to comprehend complex concepts and processes that may otherwise be challenging to grasp. DSCI 605 Data visualization serves as the foundation for understanding principles, concepts, techniques, and tools used to visualize information in large, intricate data sets. It also provides hands-on experience in visualizing big data using the open-source software R. Through the course, students will learn to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization designs and think critically about decisions, such as color choice and visual encoding. Additionally, students will create their own data visualizations and become proficient in using R.The course comprises four sections. The first section caters to learners with minimal or no experience in R, establishing the groundwork for data visualization with R. The second section introduces preliminary data visualization techniques, allowing students to gain hands-on experience with common visualization practices for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using ggplot2. This section emphasizes data exploration before delving into advanced data mining. The third section builds upon existing data visualization skills by delving into advanced data visualization topics, including interactive data visualization, time series plotting, and spatial mapping.   \n\nThe primary objective of the first three sections is to equip students with a well-developed set of skills, enabling them to create a wide range of visualizations in R. The final section focuses on completing a final project, where students apply the skills, theory, and experiences gained from the previous sections. The project entails developing a data visualization that effectively communicates a compelling story to the audience and readers.",

The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students interested in tackling all facets of optimization applications. You will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest.

    "content": "The coordination of life in multicellular organisms is precisely controlled by cells via various internal and external signals. Cells depend on different types of signals to regulate their growth, division, metabolism as well as death. Signals are growth factors or hormones produced and secreted by other cells. Some signals such as nutrients are in the form of molecules from the environment. Signaling molecules are sensed by direct binding to specific receptor molecules. Depending on the biochemical properties and ways of molecules changes, we can group various signaling events in defined pathways. Throughout specific signal transduction pathways, a signal can modulate cellular activities and gene expression, thereby leading to changes in cell growth, metabolism, differentiation, or many other cellular functions. When genetic mutations or biochemical changes occur in key proteins of certain cellular signaling pathways, cellular homeostasis can be disrupted, thus triggering tissue malfunctions, itiation or spread of cancer, or developmental anomalies. Dissecting biochemical principles of these cell signaling pathways is essential for us to better understand mechanisms of both normal cells and pathological conditions, therefore our knowledge on signal transduction will provide valuable information to develop effective therapeutic agents to fight against diseases..This 6 week-course will give you a solid introduction to the basic fundamentals of cell signaling. I will first define the concept of cell signaling and introduces major types of cellular signaling events. Throughout 6 weeks, we will study biochemical basis of electrical signaling, chemical signaling as well as gap junction-mediated signaling pathways. We will also learn about key principles underlying signal transduction pathways by studying significance of protein-protein interactions and signaling second messengers. In the end of each week, dysregulated cell signaling in pathological conditions such as cancer and diabetes will be presented and discussed. Everyone knows that cell signaling is essential for sustaining life. How can you explain insulin actions in lowering glucose in biochemical details? What can be the fundamental mode of oxygen sensing in our body? Have you ever thought about ways of how we can specifically remove or kill certain types of rapidly-growing cancer cells? Cell signaling accompanies various biochemical strategies to sense and transmit signals inside our cells. Without fine control of those signaling processes, cells, tissues, and organisms cannot maintain life.",

You will learn here how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry. For that, we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplane's movement and attitude in space, and a refresher on basic general mechanic principles. You will remind how Newton's 2nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple - or on an airplane, to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed. Coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy, you will discover the very useful concept of total height and you will be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude, while changes in total height are much slower.In the end, you will discover that only a very small number of forces apply on an airplane in flight and that you will be able to classify those that change its energy state and those that modify its trajectory. You will discover the concept of load factor and understand why the pilot of a combat aircraft can feel a weight nine-time greater than his actual weight! Finally, we will establish the lift and propulsion equations, that form the basis of flight mechanics, and you will be able to compute the lift and thrust necessary to follow a given trajectory at a given speed.\n\nThis course is for anybody interested in learning more about how planes work, the physics of flying, or flight mechanics. It will be of particular interest to undergraduate students in aerospace engineering, trainees as well as senior pilots, journalists, and professionals in the aeronautics sector.\n\nAlthough some mathematical formalism may be present sometimes. It is always doubled by sketches, figures, and hands-explanations. So that, anybody can skip the formulas without losing the core understanding of the concepts.\n\nNo apples were harmed in the making of this course...\n\nThis course is only a foretaste of the mechanics of flight. ISAE-SUPAERO and Eric Poquillon will offer you other courses and the first specialization in autumn 2021. Initially, three courses will be published to answer several questions: Can we fly as high as we want? What is a stall? Why do some planes have propellers and others have jet engines? Is an airplane always stable? How do you control an airplane following an engine failure? All this and more will be covered in this series of flight mechanics courses.\n\nThis course is a part of the specialization \"Fundamentals of Flight mechanics\".",

For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethovenâs music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethovenâs music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethovenâs music itself. \n\nThis season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson. \n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis's lifelong learning initiatives.",

We'll explore all the parts which make this work, so you can use this experience as a foundation for your own projects. We'll use the Raspberry Pi as an \"embedded system\" (as opposed to a desktop computer) so you're ready to build a Raspberry Pi into your projects as the brains that make it all work. Want to build your own Internet of Things (IoT) device? Home automation? Robotics? This is the class to learn how it all works, to get you building on your own. No experience in embedded systems, programming, or electronics is assumed, and optional bonus sections are provided for those who want a fast start in Python programming, Linux essentials, and basic electronics. The course is divided into four modules to explore each focus area with demontrations and extras along the way: 1) installing and configuring a Raspberry Pi, 2) accessing the Raspberry Pi over the network, 3) programmatically controlling external sensors and motors, and 4) accessing the embedded device through a web interface. After these four modules you'll get started building your own projects right away, and the three follow-on courses in this Coursera specialization dive into each area to really boost your skills and the complexity of your projects.

The scope and content of this course has been developed from the ground up by a combined team of academics and practitioners drawing on decades of real-world public health experience as well as deep academic knowledge. Through short video lectures, practitioner interviews and a wide range of interactive activities, learners will be immersed in the world of public health practice.Designed for those new to the discipline, over three modules (intended for three weeks of learning), learners will become familiar with the scope, theory and implementation of behaviour change in the context of public health practice. The course begins by challenging learners about their preconceptions about healthy and unhealthy behaviour - seeking to contextualise these ideas within the broader public health approach (the first course of this specialisation). The course thereafter swiftly covers the origins of risk communication and behaviour change through the lens of health psychology and classical economics, before introducing ideas of bounded rationality and the genesis of behavioural insights and so-called Nudges. By the end of the course, learners will be fluent with their use of the Behaviour Change Wheel methodology of intervention development and the application of the COM-B framework to a range of target behaviours and behavioural barriers.\n\nThe subsequent courses of this specialisation will cover health protection before moving into the final (degree learner) course which where learners will focus on developing the core professional skillset that defines public health practitioners - whether in service or academia.",

This course, âBeyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,â is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrackÂ® Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity.Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, weâll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the worldâs most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.\n\nThroughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nationsâ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.\n\nIn this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking.

    "content": "With its walls razed to ground by Babylonâs armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished citiesâfrom Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanityâs greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authorsâ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.",

With more than 99% of all mediated information in digital format and with 98% of the world population using digital technology, humanity produces an impressive digital footprint. In theory, this provides unprecedented opportunities to understand and shape society. In practice, the only way this information deluge can be processed is through using the same digital technologies that produced it. Data is the fuel, but machine learning it the motor to extract remarkable new knowledge from vasts amounts of data. Since an important part of this data is about ourselves, using algorithms in order to learn more about ourselves naturally leads to ethical questions. Therefore, we cannot finish this course without also talking about research ethics and about some of the old and new lines computational social scientists have to keep in mind. As hands-on labs, you will use IBM Watsonâs artificial intelligence to extract the personality of people from their digital text traces, and you will experience the power and limitations of machine learning by teaching two teachable machines from Google yourself.",

    "content": "Global business ethics is the study and analysis of how ethics and global business are connected. Because commerce is about markets, and  markets entail exchanges between people and groups of people, commerce is about human relationships..One of the important challenges in global business is working out the extent of these obligations in the interrelationships between businesses and the particular local cultures in which that business operates. The ethical issues arising from these engagements, the kinds of values-based considerations out of which an organization negotiates with local concerns, and how an organization can be both an enabler of economic value while respecting cultural differences are important topics of this course. \n\nYou will be able to: \n\nâ¢ Become morally sensitive to ethical dilemmas in global commerce \nâ¢ Identify ethical issues in global business \nâ¢ Master stakeholder analysis \nâ¢ Use a well-reasoned process by which to arrive at ethically defensible decisions \nâ¢ Differentiate between good and weak ethical arguments and defend conclusions \n\nThis course is part of Gies College of Businessâ suite of online programs, including the iMBA and iMSM.

This course is designed to help an investor, businessperson or economist approach macroeconomic, institutional and international data and derive information from the indicators that point to the types of opportunities and risks that they present.  Students will gain practice by handling the data of some of the largest economies in the world âthe United States, Japan, the European Union, China and Indiaâand âreading the storyâ of their economies from their data, yielding surprisingly profound conclusions about their present and future. The course is the third in a series for the specialization but it is also a stand-alone course for anyone who wants practice in practical macroeconomics.This course includes 4 modules, each one deep-diving into the macroeconomic circumstances that have been brought up in the recent history of four key regions: the USA, Japan, Europe, and China and India.  Students will analyze the ways in which international economies relate with one another, the benefits of trade and migration and economic development and how it occurs, among other themes.  \n\nProfessor Allard takes overarching macroeconomic theory and turns it into a practical tool for those interested in the opportunities and risks of investment and doing business in each of the four regions covered.",

Course 3 has nine lessons spread out over 4 weeks with 31 Learning Objectives. In this course, we will discover who and what funds the exploration that we have enjoyed learning about in Course 1 and 2. We will also focus on a few specific applications of some of the concepts we have learned about so far with two companies, the Global Positioning System, and the an academic program that could be implemented at your institution of higher learning.Week 1 - There are three lessons this week that will cover a range of topics that greatly influence where space exploration has been, is today, and will go. The Politics of Space, with Jack Waldorf and Abby Benson will provide a basic overview of how space missions are funded in the US government. Space Governance with Dr. Zach Donohew and Eric Alston, JD will present the case and justification for how we as species will need to govern what we do in space. The Business of Space with Dr. Dan Baker, will cover the basics of the space industry from the size to the value of doing business in space. These topics will build on many of the others we have covered in the other courses and in the lessons ahead.\n\nWeek 2 - This week's topic is Space Entrepreneurship and it is broken it into two parts. Both parts involve real-world space entrepreneurs. Part 1 is with Dr. James Stuart who has started many space companies and continues to work with other entrepreneurs as they push the boundary of what we do in space. Part 2 is with Scott Tibbitts, who has a very unique background and path to being a space entrepreneur but that did not stop him and his company from enabling NASA to explore Mars. These lessons will give you a new perspective on the impact entrepreneurs have in space exploration.\n\nWeek 3 and Week 4 are application lessons where we take a deep dive into a few of the many examples where space is used in our daily lives and how companies and academic programs are helping to bring access to space to everyone. The Global Positioning System (GPS), with Dr. Penny Axelrad, is so ingrained in our daily lives that we may not even realize we are using it. We will discuss how it came to be and how it will be used for years to come. David Ferguson and I will discuss SpaceX's Starship and Starlink programs and how one company is changing our vision for how we explore and use space. The Access to Space for All with Sierra Space, with Dr. Janet Kavandi, covers how one company, that many may not have heard of, has big plans for science and tourism in space. Dr. Kavandi also has some interesting space experience! The last lesson of this course covers an academic program at the University of Colorado Boulder call the Space Minor. Ashleigh Bailey and I discuss this unique program that allows students of all majors to minor in space. This program is a model of other institutions of higher education around the world. \n\nSo please consider enrolling and then let's hit the trail.",

    "content": "Los cursos de CÃ¡lculo Diferencial y CÃ¡lculo Integral tradicionalmente se ofrecen separados y respetando ese orden. El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo, la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental del CÃ¡lculo (TFC) para establecer la relaciÃ³n entre ambos conceptos. En el presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio.Vamos a iniciar con la interpretaciÃ³n del Teorema Fundamental del CÃ¡lculo, con esto nos referimos a descubrir su significado real en la soluciÃ³n de problemas. Llegaremos a asociar con Ã©l la actividad prÃ¡ctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud que estÃ¡ cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretaciÃ³n, los conceptos de derivada e integral se verÃ¡n relacionados desde un principio, lo que te permitirÃ¡ predecir el valor de una magnitud que estÃ¡ cambiando. Las nociones fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de ârazÃ³n de cambioâ y de âacumulaciÃ³n del cambioâ, y el TFC nos proveerÃ¡ de la estrategia de soluciÃ³n.\n \nRecordarÃ¡s que la MatemÃ¡tica Elemental incluye el Ãlgebra, la GeometrÃ­a y la GeometrÃ­a AnalÃ­tica. Podemos decir que Ã©stas son MatemÃ¡ticas que estudian lo estÃ¡tico. En cambio, la MatemÃ¡tica Superior, que incluye el CÃ¡lculo, estudia lo dinÃ¡mico. Con el CÃ¡lculo se inicia el estudio del cambio, una realidad presente en nuestro entorno cotidiano sin duda alguna. Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energÃ­as, capitales de inversiÃ³n, longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrÃ¡s entender al CÃ¡lculo como una estrategia de soluciÃ³n para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo de las MatemÃ¡ticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante informaciÃ³n.\n \nAl finalizar este curso podrÃ¡s:\n\nDescribir de quÃ© manera los modelos matemÃ¡ticos polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonomÃ©tricos (seno y coseno), son una construcciÃ³n que responde a esta prÃ¡ctica de predicciÃ³n. Los verÃ¡s a todos ellos surgir de esta prÃ¡ctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas condiciones en su ârazÃ³n de cambioâ con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende. \n\nUtilizar la introducciÃ³n de procesos infinitos (Â¡no imposibles!) en la construcciÃ³n de la respuesta de predicciÃ³n, con ello entenderÃ¡s por quÃ© se habla de MatemÃ¡tica Superior y de un pensamiento matemÃ¡tico avanzado.\n\nValorar una forma de pensar diferente, donde nuestro razonamiento matemÃ¡tico trascienda la sola manipulaciÃ³n de fÃ³rmulas algebraicas.",

First, each is an example of a quantity that is computed by evaluating a definite integral.  Second, the formula for that application is derived from Riemann sums.Rather than measure rates of change as we did with differential calculus, the definite integral allows us to measure the accumulation of a quantity over some interval of input values.  This notion of accumulation can be applied to different quantities, including money, populations, weight, area, volume, and air pollutants.  The concepts in this course apply to many other disciplines outside of traditional mathematics.\n\nWe will expand the notion of the average value of a data set to allow for infinite values, develop the formula for arclength and curvature, and derive formulas for velocity, acceleration, and areas between curves.  Through examples and projects, we will apply the tools of this course to analyze and model real world data.",

    "content": "The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance.Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\n\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \n\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\n\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

Understanding your cat and dogâs behaviour and the way they communicate with you, will enable you to better understand their needs and strengthen your relationship with them.This MOOC is divided into five topics, the appliance of science; behaviour and body language, senses and perception; challenges for the human-animal relationship, including pet problem behaviour; and how to improve the quality of life for cats and dogs in our care.\n\nAt the start of the course we ask you to consider what you feel is important to your cat/dog and what your cat/dog means to you? We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society? This MOOC explores different scientifically validated methods that can help you to better understand your pet, to enrich their lives and help you to be a more educated and confident pet owner.\n\nLearners can apply for Financial Aid directly with Coursera to assist with the cost of accessing the full course and gaining a certificate for successfully completing the course.",

Thus, chemical biology can harness rapid chemistry to observe or perturb biological processes, that are in turn reported using physical assays, all in an otherwise unperturbed living entity.Although its boundaries are endless, the multidisciplinary nature of chemical biology can make the field seem daunting; we beg to differ! Here, we deconstruct chemical biology into its core components, and repackage the material. In the process we build up for each student a practical and theoretical knowledge bank that will set these students on their way to understanding and designing their own chemical biology experiments. \n\nWe will discuss fluorescence as a general language used to read out biological phenomena as diverse as protein localization, membrane tension, surface phenomena, and enzyme activity.

Thermodynamics can assess the viability of a process and is one of the curriculum's most essential topics. The principles are utilized in following engineering courses (kinetics, mass transfer, design, materials) and are applicable to numerous engineering disciplines. The increased emphasis on energy usage and transformation as a result of rising demand, diminishing supply, and global warming necessitates that the engineers who will tackle these issues have a firm grasp of thermodynamics.The first and second laws will be studied in this course. Non-ideal features of single-component and multicomponent systems will be emphasized.

    "content": "An appreciation of thermodynamics is required to become a chemical and biomolecular engineer. Thermodynamics can assess the viability of a process and is one of the curriculum's most essential topics. The principles are utilized in following engineering courses (kinetics, mass transfer, design, materials) and are applicable to numerous engineering disciplines. The increased emphasis on energy usage and transformation as a result of rising demand, diminishing supply, and global warming necessitates that the engineers who will tackle these issues have a firm grasp of thermodynamics.The first and second laws will be studied in this course. Non-ideal features of single-component and multicomponent systems will be emphasized. A substantial portion of the course is devoted to solution thermodynamics, which is crucial for separations (e.g., distillation, extraction, membranes), and chemical equilibrium, which is crucial for reaction engineering.\n\n\"A theory is more striking when its premises are simpler, when it relates more diverse types of things, and when its scope of applicability is broader.

    "content": "In this course, we dive into the topic of child development. You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.In order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.\n\nTo illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University. These scientists will give a look in their field of knowledge and their collaboration with colleagues, to illustrate how the theory you will learn translates to practice.\n\nIn sum, we invite you to follow us on a journey to understand child development from synapse to society!",

Themes covered include the epidemiology of maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, relevant issues for the global health workforce, community-based interventions to improve maternal and newborn health and survival, and sociocultural dynamics surrounding birth.This course provides a broad overview of maternal and newborn health issues facing low-income and transitional countries, where more than 2.6 million babies are stillborn and nearly 500,000 women die during childbirth or from pregnancy-related complications each year. In the developing world, many women deliver at home without a skilled care provider, drugs, or technological supports. Maternal and newborn survival can be improved by mobilizing communities and improving access to skilled care.\n\nThrough lectures, case studies and readings, course participants will learn about delivery challenges for maternal and newborn health services and how to utilize community-based strategies to improve the health and survival of mothers and babies.",

This study continues today, following the same chimpanzee families that Jane Goodall first encountered over 55 years ago. Guided by three course instructors who have lived and worked with the Gombe chimpanzees, you will learn how Goodallâs early discoveries changed our view of human uniqueness. By completing the course, you will gain a new appreciation of the deep similarities between chimpanzees and humans in intelligence, tool use, hunting, personality and social relationships, as well as some key differences. You will learn how chimpanzees interact with their environment and how their behavior is influenced by ecology, as well as the severe conservation challenges they face today. And you will employ your new knowledge of chimpanzees to construct a persuasive argument for their protection. This course is open to everyone interested in learning more about these fascinating and complex beings. Knowledge of high-school level biology is beneficial but not required. Please keep in mind, however, that the content of this course will cover all aspects of chimpanzee life, including scientific discussion of sexual and aggressive behaviors.",

    "content": "One of the most significant changes in the world in the past 30 years is the opening of China to the outside world and its engagement with that world. In the initial years of the opening, external forces influenced Chinaâs economy, regional balances, bureaucracy, as well as the political authority of local leaders in the coastal areas. More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected Chinaâs internal development. We then look at various aspects of Chinaâs âgoing out strategyâ â its search for energy, talent, as well as its relations with the United States and the states within the Asia-Pacific region. The instructor has been deeply engaged in research on all these topics, having lived in China during various stages of Chinaâs opening to the outside world.Course Overview video: https://youtu.be/7FpNL67EbE4",

    "content": "This course offers a conceptual framework for understanding China that highlights the intersection of politics and economics. It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a âpoliticalâ economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leadersâ decisions. Finally, we assess Chinaâs future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese Politics Part 2 â China and the World.Course Overview video: https://youtu.be/7FpNL67EbE4",

He examines the meaning and significance of four key virtuesâkindness, hope, humility, and generosityâand their importance to living a good life. \n\nFurther, you will consider the practical aspects of living a virtuous life. We will discuss the challenges to living the virtues, and examine how they can be cultivated by incorporating contemplative practices in your everyday life. \n\nWeek 1 draws on baptism as our initiation into a new story and way of being in the world. In Week 1, you will explore the virtue of kindness through the character of God, reflected in how we treat ourselves and others. Week 2 focuses on hope. In Week 3, you will explore the virtue of humility, and reflecting on the paradox that trying to be humble often ends in pride. Finally, Week 4 closes with an exploration of generosity, demonstrating how different virtues reveal the God who is unrelentingly generous.",

Este curso busca facilitar la comprensiÃ³n de cÃ³mo es ese proceso y, para ello, se enfoca exclusivamente en el subsector de la energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica.Para desarrollar un proyecto de ciencia de datos energÃ©ticos se necesita que confluyan dos tipos de conocimiento: por una parte, un conocimiento sobre el sector elÃ©ctrico (cÃ³mo es su estructura, cuÃ¡les son sus principales retos, cÃ³mo funciona) y , por otra, un conocimiento sobre la ciencia de datos (cuÃ¡les son sus fundamentos, cÃ³mo opera, quÃ© tipo de aportes puede dar). Por esa razÃ³n, es usual que se constituyan equipos interdisciplinarios en los que confluyen tanto expertos en energÃ­a como expertos en anÃ¡lisis de datos. \n\nNo es fÃ¡cil para estos expertos poder dialogar, porque el conocimiento especializado suele tener tambiÃ©n un lenguaje especializado y no es fÃ¡cil compartir la experticia con personas que no son especialistas en nuestro campo de conocimiento. \n\nJustamente, este curso busca ayudar a facilitar ese diÃ¡logo y a sobrepasar esas barreras de comunicaciÃ³n. \n\nPara ello, lo que haremos serÃ¡ presentar los elementos bÃ¡sicos, fundamentales de cada una de las dos Ã¡reas del conocimiento con una perspectiva mÃ¡s amplia que profunda. El propÃ³sito es el de adquirir una comprensiÃ³n de alto nivel de tanto los elementos del sector elÃ©ctrico como de la ciencia de datos. Aspiramos que, al finalizar exitosamente este curso, usted pueda entender y explicar cÃ³mo funciona el proceso de ciencia de datos aplicado a los problemas del sector elÃ©ctrico.\n\nÂ¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡ estructurado el curso? El curso tiene seis mÃ³dulos y en cada uno de esos mÃ³dulos trabajamos un tema del Ã¡rea de energÃ­a y un tema del Ã¡rea de ciencia de datos, que confluyen en una aplicaciÃ³n concreta o, al menos, en una etapa de una aplicaciÃ³n concreta. En cada mÃ³dulo, usted encontrarÃ¡:\n- videos explicativos\n- un laboratorio no calificado\n- un laboratorio calificado\n- un cuestionario calificado.\n\nLos laboratorios son espacios para desarrollar tareas en lenguaje Python. No esperamos que usted sea un experto desarrollador de programas en Python, pero sÃ­ que tenga algÃºn tipo de experticia en programaciÃ³n. \n\nÂ¿Para quiÃ©n es este curso? Hemos imaginado este curso teniendo en mente dos posibles perfiles:\n1) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos sobre el sector energÃ©tico que quiere explorar quÃ© puede aprovechar de la ciencia de datos; y\n2) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos en ciencia de datos que quiere explorar cÃ³mo puede aportar esos conocimientos en el Ã¡rea del sector energÃ©tico. Por ej.: Este curso estÃ¡ dedicado principalmente a estudiantes universitarios de primer y segundo aÃ±o interesados en ciencia e ingenierÃ­a, junto con estudiantes de secundaria y profesionales interesados en programaciÃ³n.",

    "content": "Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  \n\nThis course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.",

    "content": "Circular Product Design Frameworks and Certifications is the third and final course of the Circular Product Development for the Circular Economy specialization.  The aim of this course is to explore different circular design frameworks such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's collaboration with IDEO to create a Circular Product Design Guide, the partnership between industry and research teams that culminated in the CIRCit Guide to Circular Product Design and Development, and Biomimicry 3.8's Guide to best practices. If the first two courses in the specialization describe what circular product and packaging design is and what it can achieve, this course is about the processes and methodologies necessary to make it happen.The course begins by examining the motivation for circular product design, highlighting what is happening at major corporations such as IKEA, as well as for regulatory mandates, such as the European Union's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (the ESPR). The course then dives into the Ellen MacArthur Foundation-IDEO's 4-Phase Design Guide based on human-centered design and design thinking. The Circular Product Design approach defined by the CIRCit Project is also examined in detail, as it dovetails nicely into existing stage-gate product development processes. The course then briefly discusses biomimicry as an innovative way to emulate nature's solutions to today's challenges. Increasingly, consumers (and investors!) are interested in more sustainable and circular products, and one way of demonstrating a company's success is with a 3rd party certification. Therefore, the course wraps up with a focus on the Cradle-to-Cradle Products Innovation Instituteâs certification process. Included in this course is a comprehensive set of tools, worksheets, and activities that can be used by any product design team interested in developing circular products that benefit both people and the environment.\n\nThis course was developed in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of the \"Design for the Circular Economy\" collection. Learners who complete and pass the course can receive an industry-recognized digital badge.\n\nThe âDesign for the Circular Economyâ microcredential and graduate certificate are developed around the educational goals of providing technical, business, and leadership knowledge and skills that inspire the transformation towards a more circular economy. This includes gaining technical knowledge to apply circular economy principles in product design, minimizing waste and maximizing impact; developing business acumen to implement innovative circular economic models that prioritize sustainability and resilience; and acquiring leadership strategies to communicate effectively and inspire change within an organization. \n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulderâs Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the ME-EM is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience.

It is organized around five key modules: (1) Why Cities Matter,  (2) A World of Cities,  (3) The Creative City, (4) The Divided City and the New Urban Crisis, and (5) How to Find the Best Place for You.\n\n After completing the course, you will be able to:\n\n\n(1) Identify why cities are the drivers of economic prosperity;\n(2) Explain the drivers and implications of fast-growing urbanization worldwide;\n(3) Outline the key characteristics of a creative and innovative city;\n(4) Describe the social divides and challenges facing cities and the solutions cities are using to address them; and\n(5) Recognize the trade-offs of staying in your current city versus moving, and identify the best place for you and your family to live.\n\nOf course the world has changed a great deal since I developed this course. The Global COVID-19 Pandemic is affecting cities, businesses and people around the world. It is something I have been writing about and working with mayors, city managers, economic developers, urban leaders and communities across the globe. I have put together a new module on Cities and the Coronavirus to help you better understand the ways in which the Covid-19 crisis is impacting cities and how you can best understand  and deal with that.\n\nIâd like to wish each and every one of you good luck as you get started on this journey. I hope you enjoy the course!",
