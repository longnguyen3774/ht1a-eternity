    "content": "This particular course entitled “Pipe Material Specification” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at piping system design aspects. The major differences between tube and pipe should be known to the designer first. The right selection of the straight pipe for a given process requirement is entirely based on the sound knowledge of the designer on pipe manufacturing techniques, pipe ends, pipe materials, and ASME B31 pressure piping series. Designers should be capable of determining the pipe wall thickness for the internal pressure as well as external pressure based on the ASME B31.3 code and selecting of proper schedule number from the ASME B36.10M  and B36.19M standards. Piping is composed of pipe fittings, valves, flanges, gaskets, nuts and bolts, etc. Therefore, designers should be acquainted with various types of fittings, importance, ends, pressure-temperature ratings, and material. Similarly, designers should be acquainted with various types of flanges, ends, face finishing, pressure-temperature ratings, materials, and similar knowledge on gaskets and nuts and bolting. Valves are used for isolation, regulation, and one-way operations. Therefore, types, end connections, material, pressure-temperature ratings,  internal construction, internal parts, and functioning of valves should be known to the designer for their right selection. PFDs, P&IDs, General Arrangement Drawings (GADs), and Piping Isometrics are important drawings for any process plant; and development, reading, and interpreting these drawings is one of the desired requirements that the designer should possess. To fulfill this requirement the designer should be thorough with certain symbols used to present a three-plane piping system on a 2D sheet such as GADs, etc. The designers must familiarize themselves with general abbreviations, service codes, line number identification, ‘insulation and heat tracing codes’, representations of pipelines, boundaries, off-page connectors, pipe fittings, piping valves, piping components, and ‘fire, and safety’. In a nutshell, the designer should be thorough with the legend sheet of a particular industry.The flexibility of a piping system is a major issue and it is dicey if the piping system doesn’t have inherent flexibility. Therefore, designers should be masters in all aspects of pipe stress analysis and perform flexibility analysis using industry-accepted pipe stress analysis software. They should be in a position to suggest the optimum pipe routing with appropriate supports, hangers, and expansion joints. To become an expert in flexibility analysis the designer should be well familiar with various types of primary supports, secondary supports, various types of hangers, good practices followed in piping and equipment layout known as layout rules, and expansion joints. Further, it is a requirement expected from the designer, i.e., the design of jacketed piping.  Vibration-induced loads are to be included in the pipe flexibility analysis. Unless the designer knows the sources for pipe vibration and types; the effect of vibration cannot be captured in the stress analysis process. The piping system needs insulation and a thorough knowledge of the types, shapes, and materials is essential. Pipes may be routed through underground. Therefore, designers should be capable of making the decision when the underground piping is preferred. If preferred, the designer should know what sort of challenges going to be faced that arise from corrosion and land sliding, and what are remedial solutions.  Hence, designers should know about proper cathodic protection as it is one of the remedial solutions to prevent the UG pipe.\nThe course is aimed to address all these aspects and these essential topics are included in the course. These are explained and demonstrated in a lucid form therefore, the learners can easily grasp the concepts and acquire the required skillset as mentioned above."

This course intends to present an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience the world—from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature.This class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3.

This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors."

Key knowledge areas are presented including:\n-An overview of postharvest loss\n-Supply chain activities such as harvesting, drying, and storage\n-Economics and markets\n-An introduction to the network of actors working in this field\n\nWe face the immense challenge of feeding over 9 billion people by the year 2050.

In recent years, postharvest loss has been recognized by major institutions including the US government, the United Nations, the CGIAR Research Consortium, and several others as a significant opportunity to impact food security and improve livelihoods. Despite this increased attention, a lack of knowledge, technical capacity, and resources remain obstacles for stakeholders worldwide to act on these issues.

This course is designed for people with some technical competencies who would like more than a \"cookbook\" approach, but who still need to concentrate on the routine sorts of presentation and analysis that deepen the understanding of our professional topics. \n\nIn practical Time Series Analysis we look at data sets that represent sequential information, such as stock prices, annual rainfall, sunspot activity, the price of agricultural products, and more.  We look at several mathematical models that might be used to describe the processes which generate these types of data. We also look at graphical representations that provide insights into our data. Finally, we also learn how to make forecasts that say intelligent things about what we might expect in the future.\n\nPlease take a few minutes to explore the course site. You will find video lectures with supporting written materials as well as quizzes to help emphasize important points. The language for the course is R, a free implementation of the S language. It is a professional environment and fairly easy to learn.\n\nYou can discuss material from the course with your fellow learners. Please take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nTime Series Analysis can take effort to learn- we have tried to present those ideas that are \"mission critical\" in a way where you understand enough of the math to fell satisfied while also being immediately productive.

You will see that estimating value functions can be cast as a supervised learning problem---function approximation---allowing you to build agents that carefully balance generalization and discrimination in order to maximize reward. We will begin this journey by investigating how our policy evaluation or prediction methods like Monte Carlo and TD can be extended to the function approximation setting. You will learn about feature construction techniques for RL, and representation learning via neural networks and backprop. We conclude this course with a deep-dive into policy gradient methods; a way to learn policies directly without learning a value function. In this course you will solve two continuous-state control tasks and investigate the benefits of policy gradient methods in a continuous-action environment.Prerequisites: This course strongly builds on the fundamentals of Courses 1 and 2, and learners should have completed these before starting this course.  Learners should also be comfortable with probabilities & expectations, basic linear algebra, basic calculus, Python 3.0 (at least 1 year), and  implementing algorithms from pseudocode.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: \n\n-Understand how to use supervised learning approaches to approximate value functions\n-Understand objectives for prediction (value estimation) under function approximation\n-Implement TD with function approximation (state aggregation), on an environment with an infinite state space (continuous state space)\n-Understand fixed basis and neural network approaches to feature construction \n-Implement TD with neural network function approximation in a continuous state environment\n-Understand new difficulties in exploration when moving to function approximation\n-Contrast discounted problem formulations for control versus an average reward problem formulation\n-Implement expected Sarsa and Q-learning with function approximation on a continuous state control task\n-Understand objectives for directly estimating policies (policy gradient objectives)\n-Implement a policy gradient method (called Actor-Critic) on a discrete state environment"

On the other hand, the discovery of human past implies the correct conservation and presentation for both experts and general public: the study and protection of the past we share every day prevent from any possible destruction, misuse, abuse and thus cancellation of human memory.“Recovering the Humankind's Past and Saving the Universal Heritage” presents to a large public Archaeology as a historical discipline: through an inter-disciplinary perspective you will follow the evolution and change of archaeology to the moment when natural sciences contributed to make the historical reconstructions scientifically sound; the aid of informatics and of virtual reconstructions gives new fascination to the already strong suggestion of Archaeology, as the discipline of discovery par excellence. Within this frame, Ebla, which is the glory of the Sapienza school of Oriental archaeology, will have an exemplary meaning in the course development as a long lasting experience on the field and an excellent example of the scientific results of combined researches and disciplines.\n\nMoreover, the course will focus on actual, innovative instruments to preserve, monitor and give value to cultural heritage through a multidisciplinary approach, based on a deep archaeological and historical knowledge but also on ICT technologies. The wide adoption of ICT technologies in our daily life is also impacting in the way in which we interact with our cultural heritage in particular in terms of preservation and dissemination of cultural objects.\n\nIn this course you will  learn the basic techniques  to digitize cultural objects and obtain 3D digital copies of a physical objects such as statues, vases or archaeological sites.  We will also discuss how to structure the raw data in order to facilitate and make effective the access to digital contents. In particular, we will present the European Data Model, a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe."

We will start with defining derivatives and options, continue with discrete-time, binomial tree models, and then develop continuous-time, Brownian Motion models. A basic introduction to Stochastic, Ito Calculus will be given. The benchmark model will be the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, but we will also discuss more general models, such as stochastic volatility models. We will discuss both the Partial Differential Equations approach, and the probabilistic, martingale approach. We will also cover an introduction to modeling of interest rates and fixed income derivatives.I teach the same class at Caltech, as an advanced undergraduate class. This means that the class may be challenging, and demand serious effort. On the other hand, successful completion of the class will provide you with a full understanding of the standard option pricing models, and will enable you to study the subject further on your own, or otherwise.\n\nPrerequisites. A basic knowledge of calculus based probability/statistics. Some exposure to stochastic processes and partial differential equations is helpful, but not mandatory. It is strongly recommended you take the prerequisites test available in Unit 0, to see if your mathematical background is strong enough for successfully completing the course. If you get less than 70% on the test, it may be more useful to work further on your math skills before taking this course. Or you can just do a part of the course."

We're going to be going over the big picture of economics- which is examining the measures we use to gauge the health of national economies and study the theories and policies aimed at improving economic health. In a nutshell, how can we use economics to make the world a better place?Through course lectures, quizzes, discussions, and problem sets, my hope is that you'll be able to digest economic news with a more discerning viewpoint, and have a more informed view about the cost and benefits of economic policy. Finally, my hope is that you've learned to look at the world around you through the eyes of an economist.\n\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\n1. Describe how GDP is used to measure macroeconomic performance. \n\n2. Describe how inflation is used to measure macroeconomic performance.\n\n3.

While AI is advanced enough to coach teams or address performance issues, it lacks the intrinsic connection to the organization that a human manager possesses. An employee who perceives themselves as working for “Company X's AI” will not feel the same level of loyalty or commitment as they would to YOU. Since AI, both literally and figuratively, cannot embody an organization or a manager, managers and leaders who delegate important communication and oversight responsibilities to AI inherit this fundamental limitation.  \n\nThis course will help you succeed in your career."

Tanto en el mundo de los negocios, como en el campo de la salud y en las ciencias sociales, entre otros, cada vez es más relevante el entendimiento de los fenómenos y situaciones de naturaleza probabilística (no determinística), y de desarrollar modelos basados en el análisis de datos para cuantificar el riesgo con el propósito de tomar mejores decisiones. Es entonces importante entender los conceptos básicos sobre los cuales se establecen los pilares de esta disciplina, los cuales permitirán más adelante convertir la probabilidad en una herramienta básica para la conceptualización y la solución de problemas reales.El curso tiene como objetivo principal que los participantes adquieran una formación sólida en los conceptos más importantes de probabilidad, y sus aplicaciones. Se hace especial énfasis en que los participantes logren una adecuada comprensión y utilización de los modelos de naturaleza probabilística en la solución de problemas de la vida real que comportan riesgo e incertidumbre.\n\nEl curso tiene un buen balance entre el rigor en el tema y la presentación del contenido de una forma simple, con base en ejemplos sencillos basado en situaciones reales, y cuenta con videos y ejercicios orientados a facilitar la comprensión de los conceptos que se cubren."

    "content": "Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner."
