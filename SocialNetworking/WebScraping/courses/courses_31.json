The project seeks to address the following research question through development and piloting of practical classroom activities: What is global competence, and how can it be learned effectively?The Think Global project explores, through international collaboration, how global competence is defined, taught, learned, and measured in the classroom. It offers a model of professional learning for teachers to support students in developing global competence and its relationship with ODS.\nSo, this training course is addressed to school teachers and other school stakeholders. The focus of the course is to empower school teachers to implement cross-curricular projects on global competence, and it is delivered in an open online platform. The course is divided into five modules. The first is an overview of cross-cultural theory on global  competences, the theoretical framework and the research and studies developed on the topic. The second module is based on principles and strategies. The third module deals with methodologies and developing global competence programs. The fourth module is about project based learning. The last module of the course consists of designing a global competence project to be implemented in the classroom. Teachers can decide what they need to work to achieve their objectives. In this way, they can decide which modules they need to work on, however it can be interesting to develop a final project to develop all the modules. It can provide teachers with a deeper understanding and reflections about our subjects and the development of global competence."

He is known for articulating a “new story” of the universe that explores the implications of the evolutionary sciences and cultural traditions for creating a flourishing future.This course investigates Berry’s life and thought in relation to the Journey of the Universe project.  It draws on his books, articles, and recorded lectures to examine such ideas as: the New Story, the Great Work, and the emerging Ecozoic era.  The course explores Berry’s insights into cosmology as a context for locating the human in a dynamic unfolding universe and thus participating in the creative work of our times. In particular, we will examine Berry’s reflections on renewal and reform in the areas of ecology, economics, education, spirituality, and the arts.\n\n\t\nCourse Rationale:\n\n\tThomas Berry was an original, creative, and comprehensive thinker, especially regarding the critical nature of our global environmental crisis.  His intellectual importance resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative.  In addition, he articulated the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing environmental issues.  He came to this realization largely through his study of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions.  Sensing the significance of these stories as “functional cosmologies” he explored the widespread influence that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals, ethics, and subsistence practices."

The only thing you still need and want to develop though, is the ability to use your imagination in the philosophical way, and that’s exactly what you’ll learn in this MOOC.\n\nFirstly, you’ll learn how to use your imagination to put definitions, analyses or conceptions of philosophically relevant notions to the test by means of imaginary examples and counterexamples, addressing questions that have been part and parcel of Western philosophy since its very inception, such as \n- ‘what is knowledge?’;\n- ‘what is the mind?’;\n- ’what is moral responsibility?’; and\n- ‘what is justice?’.\n\nSubsequently, you’ll learn how to use your imagination to develop your worldview. You’ll learn to speculate about what might explain your experiences, ranging from the commonsense explanation in terms of a mind-independent world, to sceptical alternatives, such as that you’re systematically misled by an evil demon or that only your mind exists and that it confabulates all the rest.\n\nFinally, since philosophy is not only about interpreting the world, but also about changing it -and hopefully, for the better- you’ll also learn how to use your imagination to evaluate what the right thing to do is in a given situation, what the criteria are to evaluate actions, and whether such criteria are established evermore or remain an open question."

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly.

Providing so many people with nutritious foods is a massive challenge and one that cannot be met by simply upscaling current practices regarding food production and consumption. Providing humanity with nutritional food is at the center of all decisions related to sustainable development.Agriculture is responsible for 80% of global deforestation. The food systems release 29% of global greenhouse gasses. We use an area equivalent to North and South America combined for the production of meat for consumption or to produce the food necessary to feed the animals we eat. 70% of fresh water use is related to agriculture. These figures are staggering, and they show us, that we need to rethink and transform the way we produce, distribute and consume food worldwide.\n\nThis course focuses on how food systems can become more sustainable. It consists of four modules where each focuses on an essential ingredient towards developing more sustainable food systems: (1) Boosting the small, (2) Transforming the big, (3) Losing less and (4) Eating smarter. In each of these key areas, we will meet people from different countries around the world, who labor every day to find and spread solutions that work.\n\nConnecting the challenges that must be overcome to develop a sustainable global food system with the solutions being developed by the amazing group of people you meet in this course has been a huge source of inspiration for me. I truly believe that the global food system can be transformed to sustainably meet the needs of 9-10 billion people and, with this course, I dare you to join me!"

How do they innovatively use different technologies to share the stories, grow audiences and create an active and involved community of fans? \n\nMore and more, we are also engaging with elements or franchises of larger and more complex stories across a much more diverse range of platforms like interactive web experiences, social media communities, mobile devices, theme parks, and even augmented and virtual reality. A major challenge that current and future storytellers face is being able to engage different audiences in a story that is seamlessly told across all of these different platforms.\n\n\nWHAT WILL I LEARN?\nThis course  will help you to design a strategy for developing and telling your own transmedia story. You will learn about what it takes to:\n• Shape your ideas into compelling and well structured narratives and complex story worlds\n• Identify, understand, and engage different audiences in your stories\n• Create cohesive user experiences across different platforms\n• Evaluate existing and emerging technologies to share your story with the world, and help your audience participate in the larger storyworld you create\n\nThe course provides you with a unique, authentic, and industry relevant learning opportunity. You will have access to current theory, industry examples and advice and undertake learning activities that will equip you with the tools you need to start developing your own ideas.\n\n\nWHO WILL MY INSTRUCTORS BE?\nYou will learn effective transmedia design strategies from leading UNSW Australia Art & Design academics. You will also examine case studies that demonstrate how amazing ideas, technology and audience contributions can be brought together to create dynamic storyworlds.

In this project-centered course you will develop your own, original, intellectual property (IP) into a transmedia project containing written versions of your IP on various platforms. You will begin your novel, adapt the first chapters of your novel into the opening scenes of a film or TV show and create a game design concept of your IP.Learner review: \"So much AMAZING information! The teacher and content are wonderful. Learned so much!\"\n\nThis is a course is based in \"Active Learning\" so that most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\nI am a proponent of experiential learning (also known as active learning). My lectures are short and succinct, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a writer. I will guide you, I will show you how to get there, hopefully I will inspire you, but I won’t show you how to write or what to write. That is up to you, you are the only one who can illustrate your creative thoughts, by writing them! I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write. You need to unleash your creativity and my plan is to help you to do exactly that!\n\nLearner review: \"This is the most challenging writing course that I have done so far! But, it actually made me write the first two chapters of my novel and now, I am now looking forward to finishing the novel and getting it published.\"\n\nAll of the assignments on this course are peer review. At each stage of the process, whether creating your novel, your screenplay or your video game, you will post your written work and review the works of your peers.  Peer review is an extremely important element of this course. Giving feedback and getting feedback is essential to the development of your critical thinking and your growth as a writer. It is as important as the writing itself.\n\nThis course is designed to tap into your creativity and help you to develop your skills in expressing that creativity through written words.\n\nLearner review: \"It made me stay up to 4AM a few times, but its incredible. You will learn a lot, and it is a very fun class\"\n\nWriting is a truly beautiful, amazing, satisfying thing. Imagine, putting your own words on a page to tell a story which enters your readers minds and allows them to share the thoughts, emotions and lives of your characters. It is a very rewarding experience.\n\nLearner review: \"This course really pushed me to my limits and it is an eye opener for me that there are goals that I can still achieve and accomplish through the world of writing.\""

Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.\n\nLearning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.\n\nIn this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.\n\nAll of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  \n\nWe hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.\n\nANATOMY OF THE CHEST, NECK, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F.

    "content": "This particular course entitled “Two-Phase Pipe Hydraulics & Pipe Sizing” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at predicting the two-phase total static pressure drop in a given piping system when both gas and liquid flow through it concurrently.  Pressure drops including heat transfer coefficients depend on two-phase flow regimes since two-phase patterns and local internal structure are different for different flow regimes. Therefore, the formation of various two-phase flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes is to be known to the designer, and at the same time, the influence of bend on the formation of two-phase flow regimes in upstream and downstream pipes should also be known. The presence of a bend is inevitable in the piping systems of a plant and its presence restricts the formation of certain two-phase flow regimes commonly found in individual horizontal and vertical pipes for the given flow rates of gas and liquid and pipe diameter. Surprisingly, bend allows the formation of slug flow regimes in both horizontal and vertical pipe runs of a piping system. This is a nerve-wracking issue for the designer since the slug flow regime harms the piping system and in some situations, the slug flow regime becomes the main cause of the failure of the piping system. Therefore, the designer should be cautious during the design of two-phase piping systems and avoid the slug flow regime formation at any cost while designing the two-phase piping system.Looking into the severity of two-phase flow on the piping system integrity, the present course focuses on the formation of two-phase flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes and their identification based on gas and liquid flow rates using two-phase flow pattern maps. Next, the course focuses on the effect of bends on two-phase flow regime formation in both upstream and downstream pipelines as piping systems are made of connecting straight pipe runs using bends. From this discussion, the learner gets a fair idea about the formation of a certain type of two-phase flow regime, when it happens, and why it happens. Next, the two-phase terminologies are covered as these are frequently used in two-phase piping system design. The relationship among them is equally important in the design and hence, covered in the present course. These terminologies and their relations assist the learner in understanding, analyzing, and applying the various two-phase models to design the two-phase piping system.\nCertain idealizations are to be made while dealing with the gas and liquid two-phase flow through the pipe.  Single-phase is well-established, not two-phase. To take advantage of suggested single-phase correlations by the investigators, the two-phase models are developed by assuming liquid alone flows through the pipe with the two-phase mixture flow rate. This assumption introduces the error as it does not appeal the reality. Therefore, while developing the models a term called two-phase multiplier is introduced and made as a multiplication factor to the single-phase pressure drop, to predict the two-phase frictional pressure drop within the acceptable range.  The developed models are popularly known as the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model,  Separated Flow Model, and Drift Flux Model, and the present course is focused on these models. Various two-phase multipliers, methods, techniques, and void fraction correlations are covered in detail in this course. Finally, in this course, practical two-phase problems are considered to demonstrate the prediction of total static pressure drop which is a sum of two-phase frictional, accelerational, and gravitational pressure drops using the two-phase well-known models, methods, techniques, two-phase multipliers, and void fraction correlations and how closely they predict so that learner cannot face any hiccup while he/she designing the two-phase piping systems including single path and multi-path piping systems known as piping networks."

    "content": "La Unión Europea (UE) continúa siendo una de las experiencias más avanzadas de integración económica y unión política a nivel global. Desde sus orígenes en los años 50 del siglo XX, la UE ha expandido significativamente su influencia, y hoy enfrenta una nueva serie de desafíos globales, desde la gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19 hasta las recientes crisis energética y climática, y los efectos de la guerra en Ucrania. Estos desafíos han puesto de relieve la importancia de una respuesta coordinada a nivel europeo, impulsando el desarrollo de políticas comunes en áreas clave como la seguridad energética, la defensa común y la transición hacia una economía verde.A pesar de la creciente presión de posiciones críticas y escépticas frente al proceso de integración, la UE sigue siendo un referente crucial para sus ciudadanos. Así lo refleja, por ejemplo, el Eurobarómetro de 2023, en el cual un alto porcentaje de europeos expresó su apoyo a una mayor cooperación en áreas estratégicas como la política exterior, la sostenibilidad energética y la defensa de valores democráticos. Estas cifras resaltan el papel fundamental que la ciudadanía otorga a la UE en un contexto de globalización compleja y en continua transformación.\nFrente a las crecientes contradicciones de un mundo globalizado, entender cómo estos procesos de cesión progresiva de soberanía y coordinación de la toma de decisiones afectan a los ciudadanos europeos constituye uno de los retos más apasionantes para las ciencias políticas, las relaciones internacionales y el análisis de políticas públicas. Este curso, elaborado por la Cátedra Jean Monnet en Políticas Europeas de la UAB y cofinanciado por el Programa Erasmus+ de la UE, tiene como objetivo ofrecer una comprensión profunda del funcionamiento de la UE como un sistema político único. A través de un análisis crítico, el curso explora el origen y evolución de la UE, su diseño institucional y sus principales políticas públicas.\nDirigido a un público amplio, el curso proporciona herramientas para entender cómo se definen e implementan las políticas públicas a nivel europeo y doméstico, cuáles son sus actores principales, y las dinámicas que gobiernan la relación entre las instituciones de la UE y los Estados miembros.\nLos módulos están diseñados para ofrecer una visión integral del proceso de integración europea, partiendo de los hitos históricos más importantes, el rol de cada una de las principales instituciones de la UE y el impacto del derecho europeo en las legislaciones nacionales. Este curso combina la teoría con una perspectiva aplicada, seleccionando algunos de los ámbitos políticos más relevantes para observar la “UE en acción”, tanto a nivel interno (por ejemplo, economía, política agrícola, cohesión y política ambiental), como a nivel externo (la posición internacional de la UE, la cooperación al desarrollo y el comercio exterior, entre otros). Además, el curso analiza el papel de la UE en el contexto actual de tensiones internacionales y sus esfuerzos por fortalecer la seguridad y resiliencia europeas.\nPuedes ver el vídeo promocional del curso en este enlace: https://youtu.be/SnTonWSwuS8"

We will also demonstrate how the costs of bad design can often be severe (in user experience, money, and even human lives).\n\nYou will then gain a high-level understanding of the user-interface design process. You will be introduced to common design scenarios - e.g. improving on existing designs and starting a new design from scratch - and the general design processes that tend to be used for each scenario.\n\nFinally, we will begin introducing the large body of existing knowledge on design by providing overviews of core user interface design theories and concepts.

We approach the research process as a means of systematically reducing uncertainty and demonstrate how conducting a scientific investigation can be posed as an exercise in Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We begin by exploring the scientific landscape to understand the different types of research, where they are conducted, how they are supported, and why each of these types of research is important. We then formalize scientific inquiry and the scientific method and elaborate the research process and its scientific merits. Basic concepts in probability theory are introduced leading to a conceptually simple presentation of Bayes’ Rule. We then illustrate how Bayes’ Rule provides a mathematical framework for the research process. We place an emphasis on the role that research plays in our daily and professional lives and how research skills can help us think critically, whether you’re in a technical field or not. Exercises are designed to help you improve your research skills and think more scientifically.Learners who are new to research fields or would like to improve their research skills in any field for career/professional or personal growth are encouraged to enroll. The course is taught at an introductory level such that, by the end of the course, you will be able to formulate a research hypothesis and devise a scientific research plan to test that hypothesis. To be successful in this course, you will need entrance-level college mathematics."

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\n\nPart 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’.\n\nPart 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk"

The focus will then move to less popular markets such as gold, emerging markets, real estate, hedge funds and private markets. These will be analyzed with an emphasis on their particular risks and return opportunities as well as how they can help in building efficient portfolios. Finally, the policies of central banks and their impact on financial markets will be presented to you along with the link between the economy and the price of financial assets.\n\nAll along these different steps, experts from UBS, our corporate partner, will show you how the concepts you just acquired are effectively applied in a leading global bank. This focus on practicality means you will not only understand what is going on in global financial markets but also start to figure out how you can use them to achieve financial goals, be it a client's or your own.\n\nCourse Director and main teaching contributor: Dr. Michel Girardin, Lecturer in Macro-Finance, University of Geneva"

The benefits and burdens of energy transitions are often unevenly distributed, with vulnerable communities frequently facing the greatest risks, such as displacement and environmental degradation, while having limited access to the benefits, such as cleaner energy and livelihoods.Studying justice in energy transitions can help reflect on and better understand the nature of these issues while identifying new ones along the way. Different ideas of justice can help us better understand what a fair or just transition might mean. By incorporating different ways of thinking and reasoning about justice, we can better understand and shape the goals of energy transitions.\n\nThis course provides a foundation and set of methods to connect different aspects of energy transitions to justice. In doing so, you will learn how to analyse energy transitions in reference to certain justice-related outcomes, connect your own life and energy use to justice, and build and support arguments regarding why we might think of certain aspects of transitions as just or unjust."

Students of political science simply have to accept this challenge. Yet, the diversity of political science concepts can be used as a powerful resource for learning, through intellectual techniques for stirring personal creativity.\n\nThis MOOC teaches conceptual thinking and elementary theory-building through Hyperpolitics, an interactive dictionary for understanding and working with the most central concepts in political science. Its aim is to provide students with fresh critical insights about key political concepts, offering a methodology by which users can unpack and reconstruct them on their own. Its companion open-access website serves as a powerful tool for students' practice in forging their own vocabulary while learning how to make professional use of authoritative PS internet resources.\n\nThroughout its 4 weeks, this MOOC comprises lecture sections, based on visualizations of the arguments presented; reading assignments; and practical exercises.\n\nThis course is part of the IPSAMOOC project, a joint venture Federica Weblearning-IPSA, the International Political Science Association."

You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.About the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course, you are able to:\n\n1.    Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy) \n2.    Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades \n3.    Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context \n4.    Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization \n\n\nRecommended Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy is this course important for me? \n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course? \n\nWe build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions—some more ethically, some less ethically—aren’t we?"

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college–especially for student veterans–is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.\n\nWhile this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty service members who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you’re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you’ll join us.\n\nThis online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an “orientation” for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more.

Software can’t be mined out of the ground, nor can software seeds be planted in spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn’t produced in factories on an assembly line. Software is a hand-made, often bespoke good. If a software developer is an artisan, then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if you’re not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas.This course is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Most of the technologies discussed in this course will be accessed via a command line interface. Command line interfaces can seem alien at first, so this course attempts to draw parallels between using the command line and actions that you would normally take while using your mouse and keyboard. You’ll also learn how to write little pieces of software in a programming language called Bash, which allows you to connect together the tools we’ll discuss. My hope is that by the end of this course you be able to use different Unix tools as if they’re interconnecting Lego bricks."

In this course you will learn to understand the basic idea of machine learning, even if you don't have any background in math or programming. Not only that, you will get hands on and use user friendly tools developed at Goldsmiths, University of London to actually do a machine learning project: training a computer to recognise images. This course is for a lot of different people. It could be a good first step into a technical career in Machine Learning, after all it is always better to start with the high level concepts before the technical details, but it is also great if your role is non-technical. You might be a manager or other non-technical role in a company that is considering using Machine Learning. You really need to understand this technology, and this course is a great place to get that understanding. Or you might just be following the news reports about AI and interested in finding out more about the hottest new technology of the moment. Whoever you are, we are looking forward to guiding you through you first machine learning project.NB this course is designed to introduce you to Machine Learning without needing any programming.

One way out could lead upwards: Urban air transport. By 2030, it is estimated that around 60 percent of humanity will live in cities. If it is possible to shift some of the traffic from the roads to the air, researchers believe this could help to further ensure the basic human need for mobility. But there are still some technical, social, and legal preconditions to be met. \n\nThe course gives a first introduction to the relatively new field of Urban Air Mobility, explaining the technical background as well as giving an overview of all other necessities such as air traffic management, public acceptance, and ecological sustainability. This course is primarily aimed at master's students and PhD candidates and young professionals interested in exploring new fields in aerospace."

Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\n\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents). There will be also assignments that consist in participating to discussions related to theoretical models presented in the course based on case studies of your choice, and peer assessments on your contributions.\n\nSyllabus :\n\nWeek #1 : Introduction, definition, urban questions and the use of models\n\nWeek #2 : European cities and the weberian model of integration\n\nWeek #3 : Colonial and post colonial cities\n\nWeek #4 : Industrial cities (and Socialist cities) and Marxist models\n\nWeek #5 : The American metropolis and the Chicago School, \n\nWeek #6 : Post metropolis, fragments and differences\n\nWeek #7 : Global cities and mega cities\n\nWeek #8 : Smart cities and the sociology of science and technology"

In this vulnerable urban context, many children are born and raised without having access to safe, inclusive and stimulating public spaces.The MOOC “Urban Landscapes of Care” invites students from the planning and designing disciplines to participate in this important discussion and to experience the city through children´s eyes. Based on the SDG-goal 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, you will be invited to explore, analyze and propose initiatives and strategies within the urban context that focus on early childhood development and the question of how the city can become an “Urban Landscape of Care”. \n\nThe MOOC was developed by the Peruvian urban laboratory IntuyLab in cooperation with the Bernard van Leer Foundation and the design school of the University of Applied Science UPC of Lima, Peru in the context of the Global Center of Spatial Methods for Urban Sustainability organized by the Technical University TU-Berlin and funded by the DAAD, the German Academic Exchange Service. \n\n+++ Course language: All educational material is developed in English, nevertheless, videos are recorded in Spanish. Subtitles in English are provided. +++\n\nBased on the empirical experience of the Urban95 program of the Bernard van Leer Foundation the MOOC will generate a knowledge transfer between academy and society, striving an integrated improvement of the city by generating safe and stimulating environments for young children and their caregivers. Although the MOOC will take reference to Peruvian urban reality, parallels can be drawn to other urban contexts.\n\nAfter taken this course you will be able to: \n• Analyze the urban context through quantitative and qualitative methods focusing on Early Childhood Development\n• Design safe, inclusive and stimulating public spaces for early childhood.\n• Recognize strategies of community engagement processes and participatory tools for the development of urban landscapes of care.\n• Elaborate an implementation roadmap for the realization of an urban landscape of care for young children and their caregivers."

Along the way learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a) what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user's goals are met. These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.\n\nThis means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!"

    "content": "Organizations large and small are inundated with data about consumer choices. But that wealth of information does not always translate into better decisions. Knowing how to interpret data is the challenge -- and marketers in particular are increasingly expected to use analytics to inform and justify their decisions.Marketing analytics enables marketers to measure, manage and analyze marketing performance to maximize its effectiveness and optimize return on investment (ROI). Beyond the obvious sales and lead generation applications, marketing analytics can offer profound insights into customer preferences and trends, which can be further utilized for future marketing and business decisions. \n\nThis course, developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, gives you the tools to measure brand and customer assets, understand regression analysis, and design experiments as a way to evaluate and optimize marketing campaigns. You'll leave the course with a solid understanding of how to use marketing analytics to predict outcomes and systematically allocate resources.\n\nYou can follow my posts in Twitter, @rajkumarvenk, and on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/education-marketing.\n\nThanks, \nRaj\nProfessor of Business Administration at Darden"

It is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.Course Audience\n - all health professions learners, example:\n - medical students, resident physicians, dental students,\n - nursing students, advanced practice nurses,\n - social work, pharmacy student as graduate level learners\n - as well as any and all health professionals interested in veteran-centered care\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nThis course will provide learners the opportunity to engage with material to facilitate their understanding of the origins of Academic Medical Centers and Veterans Administration affiliations, recognize and manage the influence of bias, class, and power on the clinical encounter and self-reflect on their biases that particularly affect U.S. military veterans.   This course also features several video clips from the acclaimed documentary, Where Soldiers Come From, directed by Heather Courtney.\n\n\nThe views expressed in this course are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the U.S. government."

    "content": "In December 2020, when the Covid-19 vaccine became available to the public after less than one year of development, it had the distinction of being the most rapidly developed vaccine in history. The same month, Merriam-Webster announced that “vaccine” would be the word of the year for 2021. As the world awaited a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, interest in vaccine-related topics, such as funding, development, distribution, and policy surged.In this course, students will learn about the fundamental role of vaccines as a tool intended to improve public health and how this influences policy. Topics covered include vaccine regulation and monitoring; equity and access; individual decision-making; vaccine refusal and hesitation; advocacy and awareness- raising; and various state, federal, and organizational vaccine mandates. These mandates touch every sphere of personal and public life, including work, education, leisure activities, politics, and how healthcare practitioners interact with patients. Understanding vaccine policy will facilitate decision-making in these settings.\n\nThis course is ideal for laypersons and professionals alike. It can be useful for individuals concerned\nabout their families’ health; school administrators; municipal officials; community health advocates; and others. Lawyers, with other areas of expertise, looking to learn more about vaccine policy, as well as\nmedical students and allied healthcare professionals, will also find value in this course."

    "content": "Epidemiological studies can provide valuable insights about the frequency of a disease, its potential causes and the effectiveness of available treatments. Selecting an appropriate study design can take you a long way when trying to answer such a question. However, this is by no means enough. A study can yield biased results for many different reasons. This course offers an introduction to some of these factors and provides guidance on how to deal with bias in epidemiological research. In this course you will learn about the main types of bias and what effect they might have on your study findings. You will then focus on the concept of confounding and you will explore various methods to identify and control for confounding in different study designs. In the last module of this course we will discuss the phenomenon of effect modification, which is key to understanding and interpreting study results. We will finish the course with a broader discussion of causality in epidemiology and we will highlight how you can utilise all the tools that you have learnt to decide whether your findings indicate a true association and if this can be considered causal."
