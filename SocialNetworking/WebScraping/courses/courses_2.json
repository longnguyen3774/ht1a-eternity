That's the future of software. And in this course, you'll learn how to build it.\n\nFrameworks come and go. Principles last. This course cuts through the noise to teach you how AI agents really work—using Python, the leading language for AI development.\n\nForget tutorials on trendy APIs that'll be dead by next quarter. You'll learn to build AI agents from the ground up. No fluff. No shortcuts. Just the core architecture that powers intelligent systems—knowledge that stays useful no matter how fast the landscape shifts.\n\nIn this course, you will:\n\n- Master Python-based agent architectural fundamentals - Understand the core GAME components (Goals, Actions, Memory, Environment) that make AI agents tick and how they work together in a cohesive Python system\n\n- Leverage Python's strengths for efficient agent development - Use Python's dynamic typing, decorators, and metaprogramming to create flexible, maintainable agent frameworks with minimal boilerplate code\n\n- Rapidly prototype and implement Python agents - Learn techniques to quickly design Python agent capabilities with prompt engineering before writing a single line of code, then efficiently translate your designs into working Python implementations\n\n- Connect Python AI agents to real-world systems - Build Python agents that can interact with file systems, APIs, and other external services\n\n- Create Python-powered tool-using AI assistants - Develop Python agents that can analyze files, manage data, and automate complex workflows by combining LLM reasoning with Python's extensive libraries and ecosystem\n\n- Build Python developer productivity agents - Create specialized Python agents that help you write code, generate tests, and produce documentation to accelerate your software development process\n\nWhy Principles Matter More Than Frameworks\n\nThe AI landscape is changing weekly, but the core principles of agent design remain constant. By understanding how to build agents from scratch, you'll gain:\n\n- Transferable knowledge that works across any LLM or AI technology\nDeep debugging skills because you'll understand what's happening at every level\n\n- Framework independence that frees you from dependency on third-party libraries and allows you to succeed with any of them\n\n- Future-proof expertise that will still be relevant when today's popular tools are long forgotten\n\nBy the end of this course, you won't just know how to use AI agents—you'll know how to build them in Python, customize them, and deploy them to solve real business problems.\n\nThis course will teach you these concepts using OpenAI's APIs, which require paid access, but the principles and techniques can be adapted to other LLMs."

The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society.The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.\n\nIn the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? \n\nNext, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.\n\nA further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by “conscious”? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. \n\nIn the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? \n\nThe last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have \n·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, \n·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, \n·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts ‘intelligence’ and ‘consciousness’ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness, \n·      a basic understanding of the concepts of ‘forward-looking’ and ‘backward-looking responsibility’ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI, \n·      a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem, \n·      and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues."

Understanding their classifications based on mechanism and their interplay with cooling towers enhances system efficiency. Cooling towers, categorized as natural draft, forced draft, or induced draft, contribute to the heat dissipation process, optimizing overall performance.\nAHUs regulate and circulate air, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment. Understanding their major components – filters, coils, humidifiers, fans, dampers, and controls – is essential for effective design and operation. Classification based on airflow and configuration, along with considerations for specific applications, provides a holistic understanding of AHUs.\nThis system involves the circulation of chilled water through chillers, pumps, piping, and terminal units. Different distribution schemes, such as Constant Primary Flow or Primary Variable Flow, dictate water distribution. Important terminologies like static head, dynamic head, and Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) are vital for efficient system design and operation.\nEfficient transport of fluids and air is facilitated through well-designed piping and duct systems. Understanding chilled water pipe sizing, duct sizing methods, and considerations for fittings and accessories ensures optimal system performance. Duct construction materials, insulation, and support systems are critical factors in achieving energy-efficient HVAC designs.\nExternal static pressure is a key parameter influencing the airflow and efficiency of HVAC systems. Proper understanding and management of this pressure are essential for maintaining optimal conditions. Insulation principles, encompassing heat transfer fundamentals and material selection, play a crucial role in mitigating energy losses and ensuring system efficiency.\nIn conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of these HVAC components and systems is imperative for professionals in the field. From the high side and low side equipment to the intricacies of air handling units, pumping systems, and piping and duct design, a holistic approach ensures the successful design, installation, and maintenance of efficient HVAC systems tailored to diverse environmental needs. Ongoing advancements in technology and industry standards necessitate continuous learning and adaptation for HVAC professionals to stay at the forefront of this dynamic field.\n\n\nTarget Learners:\n1.\tKnowledge of Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer \n2.\tUndergraduate students of Mechanical who are in either Vth, VIth, VIIth or VIIIth semester\n3.\tGraduate students of Mechanical\n4.\tWorking professionals with B.Tech./B.E., in Mechanical \n5.\tDiploma students of  Mechanical"

Each year, this pollution costs 7 million lives across the globe – and a lot of suffering. 1 in 8 deaths is due to air pollution. This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.What is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to “substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution”? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.\n\nDuring the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration. \n\nWe hope you will join us in the course and equip yourself to take part in this global and individual health challenge."

Para poder aplicar estas ecuaciones para resolver problemas, es necesario manipularlas  siguiendo ciertas reglas que nos da el álgebra.\n    Piensa en el álgebra como la gramática, que nos dice cómo traducir nuestras ideas al lenguaje, cómo formar frases y oraciones a partir de palabras, cómo conjugar verbos, a identificar las partes de una oración, las reglas de acentuación, etcétera.\n    En este curso, ofrecido por la UNAM, aprenderás a construir expresiones algebraicas a partir de frases, lo que te permitirá resolver problemas en los que  conoces algunos datos numéricos y necesitas encontrar otros.\n    Podrás plantear y resolver ecuaciones de primer grado, ecuaciones simultáneas y ecuaciones de segundo grado.\n    Este curso te va a ser muy útil si actualmente estas llevando un curso de álgebra en la escuela y tienes problemas con él. También si ya has estudiado álgebra y necesitas repasarla, ya que necesitas recordarla para tener éxito en otros cursos más avanzados, como Geometría Analítica, Cálculo o Estadística."

Y esta es la parte que casi iguala la capacidad de nuestro cerebro de poder decidir de forma casi instantánea y ponderar todas las variables involucradas en la toma de una decisión que puede ser de vida o muerte.\n\nCada vez que manejamos sometemos a nuestro cerebro a un continuo análisis multivariado que pondera variables como la velocidad, las condiciones del clima, del camino, las distracciones internas y externas o los imprevistos que pudiéramos encontrar. Esto es lo que hacemos en el análisis multivariado, considerar muchas variables, discriminarlas, agruparlas, relacionarlas y conformar grupos de datos.\n\nA lo largo de este curso, aprenderás las principales técnicas del análisis multivariante empleando R y R studio como herramienta de análisis, graficación y toma de decisiones. El software R de análisis estadístico y la plataforma de desarrollo R studio poseen la gran ventaja de ser de uso libre, con una gran comunidad de programadores que la enriquecen con librerías que hacen su uso sencillo y extremadamente poderoso.\n\nEn este curso, además de aprender los fundamentos de R y R studio, aplicaremos las técnicas de análisis multivariado como: componentes principales, análisis de clústeres y análisis discriminante en la solución de problemas y casos empresariales. No necesitas experiencia previa en programación solo conocimientos básicos de estadística, te guiaremos paso a paso en el uso de de estas herramientas y su aplicación."

Por lo tanto, se han planteado incentivos hacia lo que se denomina transición energética. En el ámbito del sector eléctrico, esa transición se ha centrado principalmente en la integración de fuentes no convencionales de energías renovables (FNCER) como la energía solar y eólica, así como el almacenamiento de esta en baterías, además de promover el desarrollo de la movilidad eléctrica.  Es importante tener en cuenta que en la medida que aumenta la integración de las FNCER se debe reconocer los posibles impactos en la operación del sistema de potencia. Estos impactos se podrán establecer con las técnicas analíticas de los sistemas de potencia.En este curso queremos brindarle un panorama del análisis de los sistemas eléctricos de potencia teniendo en cuenta la transición energética en la cadena de valor del sector eléctrico: generación, transmisión, distribución y uso final de la energía eléctrica. Este panorama te permitirá entender los impactos de la transición energética en los sistemas de potencia, y la manera como se pueden formalizar desde las técnicas de análisis de sistemas de potencia.  \n\nEl curso provee conceptos y técnicas de análisis de manera práctica, de fácil uso y apropiación, para que se aprenda sobre el rol de los ingenieros de sistemas de potencia que afrontan la transición energética, e identifiquen, además, las oportunidades de formación y desarrollo profesional en el sector energético, y, en particular, en la interesante área de los sistemas eléctricos de potencia.   \n\nAdicionalmente, el curso propone realizar una evaluación al final de cada módulo que le permitirá revisar los aprendizajes con las realimentaciones registradas en la plataforma, de manera que se pueda continuar progresando al conectarse nuevamente; en el caso de que decida optar por el certificado entregado por la Universidad de los Andes."

Picasso, Ed. PPUR. Des outils de base sont décrits dans les 5 premiers chapitres. Les deux derniers chapitres abordent la question de la résolution numérique d'équations différentielles. Plus précisement, nous allons étudier les chapitres suivants du livre :Chapitre 1 : interpolation, comment approcher une fonction par un polynôme?\n    Chapitre 2 : comment approcher des dérivées par des formules de différences finies?\n    Chapitre 3 : comment approcher des intégrales par des formules de quadrature?\n    Chapitres 4,5,6 : comment résoudre des (grands) systèmes linéaires?\n    Chapitre 8 : comment résoudre des équations et systèmes d’équations nonlinéaires?\n    Chapitre 9 : comment approcher la solution d’une équations différentielle (problème à valeur initiale)?\n    Chapitre 10 : comment approcher la solution d’un problème aux limites unidimensionnel par une méthode de différences finies?\n\nUn cours de deux heures est donc remplacé par des \"video lectures\" ainsi que les \"quiz\" correspondant. L'heure d'exercices est remplacée par un \"exercice\" où vous devrez faire des expériences numériques avec un programme matlab ou octave, et démontrer des résultats théoriques \"peer review\". Un questionnaire a choix multiple aura lieu à la fin du cours (30% de la note).\n\nIl faut obtenir 60% de la note pour avoir le “Course Certificate”.\n\nPour les étudiants EPFL, les heures de cours selon l'horaire is-academia sont maintenues. Vous devez visionner les \"video lectures\" de la semaine et faire les \"quiz\" avant l'heure de cours. Lors de la première heure de cours, je résoudrai l'exercice théorique (cet exercice theorique sera proposé comme \"peer review\" pour les étudiants externes). Une question du même type pourrait être posée lors de l'examen de juin. Lors de la deuxième heure de cours, je répondrai aux questions et je vous aiderai à faire l'\"exercice\" si nécessaire.\n\nLe temps de travail estimé est le suivant. Il faut compter deux heures pour visualiser les \"video lectures\" et répondre aux \"quiz\". Il faut compter une heure pour faire l'\"exercice\", qui demande de compléter un programme matlab (ou octave) et une heure pour faire l'exercice théorique \"peer review\" soit cinq heures en tout. Après ces cinq heures, vous devriez avoir acquis la matière."

It assumes you have a strong foundation in spacecraft dynamics and control, including particle dynamics, rotating frame, rigid body kinematics and kinetics.  The focus of the course is to understand key analytical mechanics methodologies to develop equations of motion in an algebraically efficient manner.  The course starts by first developing D’Alembert’s principle and how the associated virtual work and virtual displacement concepts allows us to ignore non-working force terms.  Unconstrained systems and holonomic constrains are investigated.  Next Kane's equations and the virtual power form of D'Alembert's equations are briefly reviewed for particles.Next Lagrange’s equations are developed which still assume a finite set of generalized coordinates, but can be applied to multiple rigid bodies as well.  Lagrange multipliers are employed to apply Pfaffian constraints.  \n\nFinally, Hamilton’s extended principle is developed to allow us to consider a dynamical system with flexible components.  Here there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom.  The course focuses on how to develop spacecraft related partial differential equations, but does not study numerically solving them.  The course ends comparing the presented assumed mode methods to classical final element solutions.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210."

You will gain first-hand experience of this by analyzing how animals are represented in the media. Modules 2 and 3 investigate human-animal relationships, including those that involve suffering as well as those that are beneficial. Although many people describe their pets as friends or family members, Module 2 takes a deeper dive into what constitutes friendship and family membership where other species are concerned. Module 3 examines the dark side of these relationships, focusing on animal abuse and its relationship to domestic violence. Module 4 focuses on people’s encounters with those animals outside the boundaries of the home and the farm. The way people understand and regard the species commonly considered “wild” shapes the treatment and moral status of these animals."

In this class, you’ll discover how to storyboard, develop your characters and story arc, add music to your animation, and create a final animation filled with organic movement and hand-drawn elements. \n\nWith Smitesh by your side, you’ll:\n* Create a rough storyboard to establish your idea\n* Pair music with the emotion and ideas behind your story\n* Build out your characters and background\n* Use the Performing tool and effects like Gaussian blur and glow to complete your piece  \n* Plus, you’ll get a look into Smitesh’s workflow as he creates his own animated short from start to finish. \n\nWhether you’re a natural storyteller who wants to give animation a try or you’re an animator looking to dive into a more in-depth animation project in Procreate Dreams, you’ll leave this class with the ability to plan, execute, and export a fully animated story all in one app complete with unique characters, emotional scenes, and fun animated effects. \n\nNo Procreate Dreams or animation experience is required to take this class. You’ll simply need your iPad and Apple Pencil. Previous experience with Procreate will help you in this class but isn’t necessary.\n\nInstructor bio:\nSmitesh Mistry is a graphic designer and illustrator who specializes in creating fun, abstract, and meaningful visual content. By day, he works on a wide range of design projects spanning digital and print, and in his spare time, he enjoys experimenting with new creative skills, sketching, and producing design content for his YouTube and Instagram channels.\n\nPassionate about teaching, Smitesh creates classes that make design approachable for beginners while also helping intermediate learners sharpen their skills. His goal is to inspire students to explore their creativity, gain confidence with design tools, and bring their ideas to life."

The course version on Coursera does not offer CME credit.\n\nCourse Description\nAntibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence – inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level."
