The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society.The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.\n\nIn the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? \n\nNext, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.\n\nA further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by “conscious”? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. \n\nIn the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? \n\nThe last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have \n·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, \n·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, \n·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts ‘intelligence’ and ‘consciousness’ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness, \n·      a basic understanding of the concepts of ‘forward-looking’ and ‘backward-looking responsibility’ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI, \n·      a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem, \n·      and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues.",

Classification based on airflow and configuration, along with considerations for specific applications, provides a holistic understanding of AHUs.\nThis system involves the circulation of chilled water through chillers, pumps, piping, and terminal units. Different distribution schemes, such as Constant Primary Flow or Primary Variable Flow, dictate water distribution. Important terminologies like static head, dynamic head, and Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) are vital for efficient system design and operation.\nEfficient transport of fluids and air is facilitated through well-designed piping and duct systems. Understanding chilled water pipe sizing, duct sizing methods, and considerations for fittings and accessories ensures optimal system performance. Duct construction materials, insulation, and support systems are critical factors in achieving energy-efficient HVAC designs.\nExternal static pressure is a key parameter influencing the airflow and efficiency of HVAC systems. Proper understanding and management of this pressure are essential for maintaining optimal conditions. Insulation principles, encompassing heat transfer fundamentals and material selection, play a crucial role in mitigating energy losses and ensuring system efficiency.\nIn conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of these HVAC components and systems is imperative for professionals in the field. From the high side and low side equipment to the intricacies of air handling units, pumping systems, and piping and duct design, a holistic approach ensures the successful design, installation, and maintenance of efficient HVAC systems tailored to diverse environmental needs.

Por lo tanto, se han planteado incentivos hacia lo que se denomina transición energética. En el ámbito del sector eléctrico, esa transición se ha centrado principalmente en la integración de fuentes no convencionales de energías renovables (FNCER) como la energía solar y eólica, así como el almacenamiento de esta en baterías, además de promover el desarrollo de la movilidad eléctrica.  Es importante tener en cuenta que en la medida que aumenta la integración de las FNCER se debe reconocer los posibles impactos en la operación del sistema de potencia. Estos impactos se podrán establecer con las técnicas analíticas de los sistemas de potencia.En este curso queremos brindarle un panorama del análisis de los sistemas eléctricos de potencia teniendo en cuenta la transición energética en la cadena de valor del sector eléctrico: generación, transmisión, distribución y uso final de la energía eléctrica. Este panorama te permitirá entender los impactos de la transición energética en los sistemas de potencia, y la manera como se pueden formalizar desde las técnicas de análisis de sistemas de potencia.  \n\nEl curso provee conceptos y técnicas de análisis de manera práctica, de fácil uso y apropiación, para que se aprenda sobre el rol de los ingenieros de sistemas de potencia que afrontan la transición energética, e identifiquen, además, las oportunidades de formación y desarrollo profesional en el sector energético, y, en particular, en la interesante área de los sistemas eléctricos de potencia.   \n\nAdicionalmente, el curso propone realizar una evaluación al final de cada módulo que le permitirá revisar los aprendizajes con las realimentaciones registradas en la plataforma, de manera que se pueda continuar progresando al conectarse nuevamente; en el caso de que decida optar por el certificado entregado por la Universidad de los Andes.",

The focus of the course is to understand key analytical mechanics methodologies to develop equations of motion in an algebraically efficient manner.  The course starts by first developing D’Alembert’s principle and how the associated virtual work and virtual displacement concepts allows us to ignore non-working force terms.  Unconstrained systems and holonomic constrains are investigated.  Next Kane's equations and the virtual power form of D'Alembert's equations are briefly reviewed for particles.Next Lagrange’s equations are developed which still assume a finite set of generalized coordinates, but can be applied to multiple rigid bodies as well.  Lagrange multipliers are employed to apply Pfaffian constraints.  \n\nFinally, Hamilton’s extended principle is developed to allow us to consider a dynamical system with flexible components.  Here there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom.  The course focuses on how to develop spacecraft related partial differential equations, but does not study numerically solving them.  The course ends comparing the presented assumed mode methods to classical final element solutions.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

The course version on Coursera does not offer CME credit.\n\nCourse Description\nAntibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence – inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level.",
