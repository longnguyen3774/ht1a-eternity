En el mundo contemporáneo, el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles, Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\", \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué? ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes, sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación, y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación? ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \nPor el momento, y considerando las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos, culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción, existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas, calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias, representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética; los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno, movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio, entre otros.\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas, gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos, creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \n\nTodos los vídeos realizados por Sciences Po para este MOOC están a cargo de Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\n\nPerfil recomendado\n\nEl curso está diseñado para estudiantes de pregrado, pero también puede ser de interés para estudiantes de posgrado y profesionales en el sector de asuntos urbanos.\n\n\nPrograma del curso :\n\nSemana 1: Introducción, definición, asuntos urbanos y el uso de modelos\nSemana 2: Ciudades europeas y el modelo weberiano de integración\nSemana 3: Ciudades coloniales y poscoloniales\nSemana 4: Ciudades industriales (y ciudades socialistas) y modelos marxistas\nSemana 5: Las metrópolis norteamericanas y la Escuela de Chicago \nSemana 6: Posmetrópolis, fragmentos y diferencias\nSemana 7: Ciudades globales y megaciudades\nSemana 8: Ciudades inteligentes y la sociología de la ciencia y la tecnología"

A good understanding of Business Statistics is a requirement to make correct and relevant interpretations of data. Lack of knowledge could lead to erroneous decisions which could potentially have negative consequences for a firm. This course is designed to introduce you to Business Statistics. We begin with the notion of descriptive statistics, which is summarizing data using a few numbers. Different categories of descriptive measures are introduced and discussed along with the Excel functions to calculate them. The notion of probability or uncertainty is introduced along with the concept of a sample and population data using relevant business examples. This leads us to various statistical distributions along with their Excel functions which are then used to model or approximate business processes. You get to apply these descriptive measures of data and various statistical distributions using easy-to-follow Excel based examples which are demonstrated throughout the course.To successfully complete course assignments, students must have access to Microsoft Excel. \n________________________________________\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Basic Data Descriptors\nIn this module you will get to understand, calculate and interpret various descriptive or summary measures of data.

We are faced with the necessity of examining scientific evidence on topics ranging from conservation to public health and make decisions that impact not only our families but those around us. However, in spite of decades of science education reform and dedicated efforts to improving science literacy, many members of the general public lack the confidence, skills, or interest in engaging with scientific issues, instead choosing to align their scientific decisions with non-scientific stakeholders, such as political or pop culture figures. These problems are ongoing and destructive. How do we communicate science more effectively with the general public? With other scientists?This course is designed for scientists, science educators, and science communicators who are interested in re-thinking how we communicate science to diverse audiences, particularly to the general public. Topics include evidence-based considerations of human learning as well as effective communication through a variety of modalities, including oral presentations, written forms of communication, technology, and artistic media. The objective of this course is to equip learners with the skills needed to design and implement effective methods of science communication.

Additionally, we'll use open-source filter synthesis tools to help you quickly design and simulation filters.\n\nModule 2 is all about creating professional looking electrical schematics. This is both an art and a skill and we'll cover the technical elements of using schematic entry software as well as broad concepts that are portable to any commercial application.\n\nModule 3 takes our schematic and turns it into a physical PCB design. Understanding this process of how the schematic and the PCB layout work together is critical. We'll be demonstrating this with open-source software, but again, the concepts apply to any commercial software you may have access to.\n\nModule 4 demonstrates the powerful idea of co-designing your electrical and mechanical systems together. We'll create a 3D model of our electrical PCB and bring it into 3D CAD software to design mechanical parts around it.

    "content": "La mondialisation et l'européanisation favorisent le développement rapide des villes à travers le monde. L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ?Pour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.\nToutes les vidéos produites par Sciences Po pour ce MOOC sont sous licence Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nPlan du cours\n\nSemaine #1 : Introduction, définitions, questions urbaines et l'utilisation de modèles\nSemaine #2 : Les villes européennes et le modèle d'intégration wébérien\nSemaine #3 : Les villes coloniales et post coloniales\nSemaine #4 : Les villes industrielles (et les villes socialistes) et les modèles marxistes\nSemaine #5 : Les métropoles américaines et l'école de Chicago, \nSemaine #6 : Les post-métropoles, fragments et différences\nSemaine #7 : Les villes mondiales et les mégacités\nSemaine #8 : Les villes intelligentes et la sociologie des sciences et technologies"

For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, networking issues, or working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes, it's issues with applications – like getting a sample application to work, getting the dependencies to install properly, or getting a webserver to communicate with a database server. Or at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.So we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is because some of the basic prerequisites are missing, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python, NodeJS, or web servers like Apache, NGINX, etc.\n\nAs a DevOps or Cloud Engineer it is important to have these basics cleared. And that’s why we built this course to bridge that gap. With this course, anyone can kick start their DevOps or Cloud Journey. This is the course you must take before you start with any of the DevOps or Cloud courses out there. This course helps you get your basics right so the rest of the journey is smooth.\n\nWhat are the prerequisites to attend this course?\n\n- There are no pre-requisites for this pre-requisites course\n- Good to have (Not Mandatory) a laptop to practice by yourself"

Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. \n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized."

Next, you'll explore two crucial problems: cognitive offloading — our growing dependence on digital tools for knowledge — and digital skepticism, which questions the reliability of online information sources.Building on these insights, you’ll be introduced to virtue epistemology, an approach that emphasizes the importance of intellectual character traits — like open-mindedness and intellectual courage — in acquiring genuine knowledge. Finally, you’ll put theory into practice by reflecting on how cultivating epistemic virtues (and avoiding epistemic vices) can help us meet the unique epistemological challenges of the digital age.\n\nBy the end of the course, you’ll understand how the digital environment influences what and how we know."

In this course, we explore the support that teachers need in order to meet the needs of children with severe to profound hearing, visual and intellectual disabilities.  We consider how this can be done by talking with a range of experts - from teachers to activists - about inclusive education as well as sharing experiences of education.Inclusive education is only possible if teachers are supported and empowered to make the curriculum accessible to all learners. The topics in this course cover developing disability confidence and what exactly children with specific impairments need to be able to learn. This includes sharing specific classroom strategies and teaching activities for learners who are D/deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision or have a severe to profound intellectual disability. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the impairment specific needs of learners with disabilities, and how to build systems of support for inclusive education.\n\nYou will be able to purchase a Verified Certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you may apply for Financial Aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee.\n\nThis course was developed as part of the project ´Strengthening teaching for Children with profound Hearing, Visual and Intellectual Disabilities in South Africa` co-funded by Christoffel-Blinden Mission (CBM) and the European Union."

All parts of the world face the possibility of floods, hurricanes, tornados, fires, landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural phenomena. Are you prepared if disaster would strike you? This course will help you prepare!The course is appropriate for any learner who is proactive about developing the core competencies of disaster readiness and survival planning. It is especially useful if you are seeking techniques that can ensure your personal protection, as well as the safety of your family, property, and belongings, during a natural disaster. In addition, it offers essential preparation for a variety of emergency situations and inconveniences, even if you do not live in major tornado, flood, hurricane, tsunami, or earthquake zone. For instance, could you and your loved ones manage without access to potable water, electricity, fuel, and banking facilities? If you are unsure of your ability to respond in any of these possible scenarios, this course is for you!\n\nThroughout the course, you will be introduced to the Disaster Cycle, specifically the Mitigation and Recovery phases, and will create an extensive personal preparedness plan for survival in the absence of common amenities, such as food and water, shelter, and communication. You will also acquire practical, easy-to-apply strategies for maintaining a healthy attitude during disaster which can allow you to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon inner and outer resources in dire circumstances. Although death may be an inevitable outcome of extreme circumstances, a balanced outlook can provide comfort for all parties involved.

    "content": "A Markov chain can be used to model the evolution of a sequence of random events where probabilities for each depend solely on the previous event. Once a state in the sequence is observed, previous values are no longer relevant for the prediction of future values. Markov chains have many applications for modeling real-world phenomena in a myriad of disciplines including physics, biology, chemistry, queueing, and information theory. More recently, they are being recognized as important tools in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) where algorithms are designed to make intelligent decisions based on context and without human input. Markov chains can be particularly useful for natural language processing and generative AI algorithms where the respective goals are to make predictions and to create new data in the form or, for example, new text or images. In this course, we will explore examples of both. While generative AI models are generally far more complex than Markov chains, the study of the latter provides an important foundation for the former. Additionally, Markov chains provide the basis for a powerful class of so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that can be used to sample values from complex probability distributions used in AI and beyond.Outside of certain AI-focused examples, this course is first and foremost a mathematical introduction to Markov chains. It is assumed that the learner has already had at least one course in basic probability. This course will include a review of conditional probability and will cover basic definitions for stochastic processes and Markov chains, classification and communication of states, absorbing states, ergodicity, stationary and limiting distributions, rates of convergence, first hitting times, periodicity, first-step analyses, mean pattern times, and decision processes.

This has put a spotlight on the lack of representation both on and off the football pitch. The disparity in football leadership representation is even more apparent when gender, race and ethnicity comes into play. This MOOC aims to understand, explore and ultimately address the exclusion of women and people of ethnic minority background (WEM) in football organizations. Resources and practical tools are provided for aspiring football leaders and governing body members. Ultimately, the course looks to the future of football leadership and asks what needs to be done to transform the football world from the inside out.This course consists of 4 modules or ‘weeks’. In each module, a different theme will be addressed in short expert videos. Furthermore, each week will have supplementary reading material and a brief quiz or discussion topic to apply the knowledge gained from the videos and readings. Participants are invited to relate the gained knowledge to their own experiences, personal development or ambitions to create social change within the football world. Participants are expected to watch the videos before doing the small exercises.\n\nThe European Commission's support for the production of this publication does not constitute an endorsement of the contents, which reflect the views only of the authors, and the Commission cannot be held responsible for any use which may be made of the information contained therein."

We touch on the notion of partial observability in real problems, modeled by POMDPs and then solved by online planning methods.

We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we examine a different biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.\n\nFinally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go \"dormant\" within a host for many years before causing an active infection."

This course will cover advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.In the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the \"reference genome\" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and \"map\" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins."

Il s'agit également de donner des repères permettant d'appréhender le dopage dans sa complexité.Le dopage dans le sport est une pratique complexe dont la définition et l'identification renvoient à la construction sociale et historique de normes. \n\nLe cours propose une clarification des processus qui ont conduit à l'usage et la prohibition des produits dopants. L'amélioration des performances ou les transformations des apparences sont deux aspects du dopage qui dérangent alors que pourtant les sociétés vantent les mérites de \"l'amélioration\" du corps et que les marchés du \"human enhancement\" prospèrent. Ces apparentes contradictions seront analysées en montrant que, au-delà des questions sanitaires, le dopage est au croisement de multiples enjeux sociaux, scientifiques ou encore juridiques.\n\nPour y faire face, les autorités sportives et étatiques ont contribué à la mise en place d’institutions en charge de l'identification du dopage, de politiques de prévention, de répression et de recherche. Les dispositifs biologiques de contrôle comme le passeport biologique, les dimensions juridiques qui fondent la lutte contre le dopage, les organisations de production de la performance, comme les dimensions sociologiques du dopage seront abordés par ce cours.\n\nOutre les enseignants de l’Université de Lausanne, les meilleurs spécialistes du dopage, d’un laboratoire antidopage (LAD), du TAS (Tribunal Arbitral du Sport), de l’UEFA (football) et de l’AMA (Agence Mondiale Antidopage) interviennent dans ce cours. \n\nTeaser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ZQVQsWAdo \n\nObjectifs pédagogiques principaux :\n\nA la fin de ce cours les participants seront capables de:\n\n1.\tIdentifier la dimension « culturelle » du dopage, c’est-à-dire comme pratique qui a une histoire en lien avec la transformation de normes sociales\n\n2.\tPasser d’un mode de raisonnement binaire sur le dopage, pour ou contre, à la compréhension de la complexité d’un phénomène à la fois biologique, psychologique et sociologique\n\n3.\tReconnaître les institutions, les acteurs et les pratiques de lutte contre le dopage\n\n4.\tExpliquer comment le contexte social et organisationnel pèse sur les décisions des individus et comment il peut être réduit par des mesures de prévention. \n\n5.\tIdentifier comment fonctionne la lutte contre le dopage et les procédures de contrôle"

To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.Doping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).\n\nTeaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU\n\nMain Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,\n5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out."

L’adoption d’instruments universels, régionaux et de bassins souligne l’importance d’étudier l’évolution de la réglementation internationale relative à l’eau et d’identifier les grands principes en ce domaine. Aussi, ce cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et examiner la régulation qui s’applique eaux douces transfrontières notamment aux fleuves, aux lacs et aux aquifères. Il présente les principes et les normes juridiques qui régissent l’utilisation, le partage, la gestion et la protection de ces ressources. Le MOOC est composé de 5 modules pouvant être visualisés dans un ordre quelconque, car abordant chacun un thème différent. Cependant, l’ordre des modules suit une certaine logique pédagogique et facilite la compréhension du MOOC pour des personnes ne connaissant pas le sujet. Chaque module s’accompagne d’un questionnaire d’évaluation/quiz. Le MOOC suivra un parcours unique donnant droit à un certificat pour les apprenants ayant obtenu une moyenne supérieure à 80% aux quiz.A la fin du cours, l’apprenant sera à même entre autres :\n1) de décrire les enjeux liés à la régulation des eaux douces transfrontières ; \n2) d’expliquer l’évolution de la réglementation internationale relative aux eaux douces transfrontières ; \n3) de rappeler et d’interpréter les principes et les règles qui régissent la régulation des ressources en eau ; \n4) de comprendre le rôle des mécanismes de règlement des différends liés aux eaux douces transfrontières dans le développement du droit international de l’eau douce (ou de comprendre le rôle des cours et tribunaux internationaux dans la résolution des conflits sur l’eau douce)\n\nCe MOOC a été développé par la Plateforme pour le droit international de l’eau douce qui fait partie du Pôle Eau de Genève.

Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect.Depuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein essor. De nombreuses causes sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la bannière des droits de l’homme : la protection des minorités, la lutte contre la discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions forcées, la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de l’environnement et la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces causes mobilisent tant les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont discutées dans de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.\n\nLe présent cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine vaste et complexe que sont devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les caractéristiques et les différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme ? Quels sont leurs fondements philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits sont-ils importants ? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment rendre ces droits opérationnels ? Quels mécanismes existent pour les mettre en œuvre et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients ?\n\nEn abordant ces questions, le cours s’adresse tant à des membres de la communauté universitaire qu’à des praticiens (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique, fonctionnaires, journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme et spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire et des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement désireuses de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.\n\nLe cours est conçu et dispensé par les Professeurs Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit de l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et institutions voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des spécialistes de la communauté académique seront invités à intervenir.\n\nLe cours est donné en français. Il consiste en une série de 8 sessions, comprenant chacune un certain nombre de brèves présentations vidéo (8 à 15 minutes). Chaque session s'accompagne d'un questionnaire d'évaluation. Des lectures préparatoires sont requises pour chaque session."

With this course, recorded on campus at UCSD, we seek to share our access to top people in the field who bring an unprecedented range of expertise on drug commercialization.This course will cover pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.\n\nIn addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.  \n\nThis course is intended as part 3 of a series: Drug Discovery (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-discovery), Drug Development (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-development) and Drug Commercialization.  We would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place."

Additionally you will learn how to Incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design of clinical protocols to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy in multiple therapeutic areas.\n\nIn this course you will learn the different phases of clinical development:\n\n* Phase 1 or early stage clinical trial are conducted primar­ily to determine how the new drug works in humans, its safety profile and to predict its dosage range.  It typically involves between 30 and 100 healthy volunteers.\n\n* Phase 2 or Proof of Concept POC studies test for efficacy as well as safety and side effects in a group of between 30  to 200 hundred  patients with  the disease for which the new drug is being developed.\n\n* Phase 3 or late stage clinical development involve much larger group of patients, between a few hundred to thousands, depending on the indication, which will  help  determine if the new drug can be considered both safe and effective.  It will involve control groups using placebo and/or current treatment as a comparison.\n\n* Product registration and approval process after a drug is considered safe and effective from Phase 3 trials, it must be authorized in each individual country before  it can  be  marketed. All data gen­erated about the small molecule or biologic is collected  and  submitted to the regulatory authorities in the US at the FDA, Food and Drug Administration FDA, in Europe the EMA or European Medicines Agency, Japan Ministry of Health and other countries which may require their own national  approvals.\n\nThis course is intended as part 2 of a series: Drug Discovery (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-discovery), Drug Development and Drug Commercialization (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-commercialization).

We begin by providing an overview of drug development and approval process and the role regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration, play in the approval process. We discuss phases of clinical trials – phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 – to evaluate efficacy and safety of drug products, along with case studies. We define pharmacoepidemiology – a scientific discipline to study use, safety and effectiveness of medical products and interventions – and the role it plays throughout the drug life cycle with relevant case studies. We also discuss how pharmacoepidemiology informs regulatory, policy and clinical decisions. Finally, we provide high-level overview of essential tools – study protocols, data sources, study designs and analysis – to conduct pharmacoepidemiologic studies."
