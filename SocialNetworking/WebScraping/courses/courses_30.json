Like so many of my colleagues, however, I was unprepared for the wave of mental health challenges that would face our society in 2020. From COVID-19 and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic to racial justice protests, widespread natural disasters, our current cultural moment presents unprecedented mental health concerns, and particularly for marginalized communities. For this reason, I led a field-wide call to action for mental health research and treatment that resulted in this #TalkMentalIllness course. I had the opportunity to speak to over 30 experts from different domains in psychology research, practice, and popular public figures and to discuss the causes and cutting-edge treatments for many serious disorders, the stigma surrounding mental illness in our culture, systemic inequality in mental health treatment, and the mental health challenges of today.#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.\n \nThis course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Libraries’ Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n- June Gruber"

This is a hands-on workshop that explores topics and strategies teachers can use to help their students become active investigators of light.Watch a preview video (copy and paste this link into your browser): https://youtu.be/fPvT_quBVIw\n\nThere are four weeks of course content, which require 2-4 hours per week. Each module builds upon the previous one, so we strongly suggest you follow the sequence we've outlined rather than skip ahead or do the course in less time. The course is designed to give you an opportunity to learn and share with others, not test what you know. There are weekly activity and reflection assignments, but these will not be graded. To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete the peer-reviewed final assignment.\n\nAs a participant, you will:\n- Watch videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium's approach to teaching and learning \n- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in hands-on activities based in those phenomena\n- Reflect and share your experience doing activities\n- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for teaching\n- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities\n\nEach week, we'll look at a different light-related topic: We will start by examining human visual perception, then take a brief historical tour of our evolving scientific understanding. We’ll also look at optics and optical instruments and finish by looking at the wave nature of light. \n\nTo get the most out of this experience, you'll have to try out some activities! In return, you'll get lots of valuable teaching resources, an in-depth understanding of the subject matter, and useful tips and techniques for the classroom.\n\nNOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you will need to buy or find materials. All of the materials required are inexpensive and should be easy to obtain, and we welcome substitutions! A separate list of materials is available for each activity."

The course is based upon the multi award winning open educational resource developed by Dr Simon McIntyre and Karin Watson. \n\nIntegrating online technologies into your teaching can be a challenging prospect, and it can be difficult to know how to approach it effectively for the benefit of both students and yourself. No one knows your own content and teaching strengths better than you, and the “one size fits all” formula doesn’t always suit everyone. No matter what type of technology you are interested in exploring or your level of experience, this course will help you draw on your teaching strengths and find the approach that is right for you, your students and your educational context. \n\nThis course will guide you through your journey of understanding how online technologies can enhance your course design. You will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of effective online teaching practices and their relationship to the use of different technologies. You will also be encouraged to progressively design and reflect upon your own online learning activity, assessment or resource for use in your own class if you choose to undertake the course assignments."

We’ll use insights from movie-making—not to mention from odd visual tricks in Barb’s kitchen—to see how students learn, both independently and together. We all know, for example, that social learning is valuable in helping students grapple with tough concepts as well as in making learning more fun. But if you understand what is happening in the brain during social learning, you can also understand why certain approaches commonly used in online learning, such as discussion forums, can sometimes pose a challenge.  As you will see, we can use insights from neuroscience not only to motivate our students, but to help them change their very identity.Our course is designed for university professors,  vocational instructors, K-12 teachers, coaches, business trainers, parents, and in fact, anyone who is trying to teach concepts or skills online. We're not just talking about traditional academic materials—if you’ve ever considered teaching a course on Udemy, putting up a video series on YouTube, or launching your own educational blog, this course is also for you. An essential and exciting point is that students can learn even BETTER online than they can in the traditional face-to-face classroom. That’s whether you’re teaching synchronously—that is, live, via a platform like Zoom; or you’re teaching asynchronously—that is, any time—by having videos and other teaching materials accessible to students whenever they want. \n\nYou can take this course independently from the other two \"Uncommon Sense Teaching\" courses in this specialization—some of the neuroscience- and cognitive-psychology-based insights we’ll mention here in simple ways are explored more deeply in those other courses. So feel free to take the other two courses in the specialization in conjunction with or after this course. If you’ve already taken the other two courses, you’ll find that this course reviews and extends the practical insights from neuroscience you’ve already received in unexpected new directions. And you’ll find even deeper insights we haven’t covered before.\n\nIn TEACHING ONLINE you'll be joining a trio of experienced online instructors who have taught millions in some of the world's most popular online courses.  One of our deepest goals for this course is to help YOU to teach others to improve their ability to reach and teach students. We’ve loaded the animations and visuals we've developed for this course online in PowerPoints (licensed under Creative Commons) in the assets under the videos, as well as in the resources section. You can rework these PowerPoints as you wish to reteach this material to your colleagues and students. Your sharing and resharing of this material is one of the best things you can do to help us all move teaching and learning forward to a visionary future. YOU are the foundation—children, adults, and society as a whole can leap ahead because of your desire to learn and spread these new ideas!"

Educators asked, “What if we were to study how professional writers wrote, as a way to learn how we might teach writing more effectively?” The result was the writing process movement, with its emphasis on not just writing as product but as process. Good writing doesn’t magically appear, nor does it spring from the brain fully formed and perfect the first time. Instead, all writers engage in a process, and while that process can vary writer to writer, some stages do seem to apply, in some way, to almost every writing situation. This course demonstrates how teaching writing as process can lead to a significant increase in students’ comfort level and confidence as writers. Learners will examine methods for teaching writing as discovery, and for using low-stakes writing and reflection in their classes. They’ll fill their toolbox with practical strategies and techniques for teaching writing to students of any age, in any situation."

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen."

Os álbuns deixaram de ser criados apenas em estúdios, agora também são criados em quartos. À primeira vista, isso é libertador. Qualquer pessoa pode criar um álbum por um custo bem baixo, basta comprar alguns equipamentos e um pacote de software. Mas, se você for mais a fundo, verá que não é tão fácil assim. É preciso conhecimento, dedicação e criatividade para produzir música.\n    \nFornecer conhecimento é o propósito deste curso. Não importa o tipo de música que você está produzindo, há um grande conjunto de ferramentas que você precisará usar.  Cada lição deste curso demonstrará um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produção musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produção musical de gravar, editar e mixar. \n\nVamos começar com algumas noções sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessários para gravar áudio em um computador, para que você compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produção musical. \n    \nDepois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como edição. A edição nos permite dar a impressão de execuções perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na música contemporânea. A ferramenta de edição contemporânea é a estação de trabalho de áudio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de edição que são essenciais na produção de música contemporânea e que são fornecidas por todas as DAWs. \n\nApós a edição, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se você souber usá-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades básicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserções, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som também deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da música. Vamos analisar a compressão, a equalização e o retardo, além de examinar os muitos efeitos de áudio que são extensões desses dispositivos e como eles são usados em um contexto musical.\n    \nNo fim das contas, o processo de produção musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade é um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, até que as ferramentas certas são usadas da maneira certa para compartilhá-la com o mundo. Se você tem uma ideia em mente, precisará passar por inúmeras etapas, cada uma com uma ferramenta importante, para chegar ao seu público. Traga a dedicação e criatividade para este curso, que ele fornecerá o conhecimento para fazer acontecer."

It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private businesses, and ordinary citizens. In many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security, and stability – but what does this mean exactly? \n\nOn this six-week course from Leiden University, you’ll explore the essence of terrorism and discover why it is so difficult to define. Unpacking its history and the theory of the waves of terrorism, you’ll analyse both the theoretical approaches and practical applications of terrorism and counterterrorism in the real world.\n\nThere are many assumptions that cloud the subjects of terrorism and counterterrorism. These myths are often created and intensified by individual bias, the government, and the media. On this course, you’ll discover different assumptions about terrorist identities and motivations, as well as the efficiencies of various counterterrorism efforts. You’ll then compare this with academic research to investigate the truth behind these assumptions.\n\nIn your exploration of the impact of terrorism, you’ll delve into the culture of fear created by terrorism, as well as the success of counterterrorism policies to limit and manage its impact on society.

Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people’s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text.This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines."

What’s left is focus, instinct, and play.The lessons in this course don’t tell you what to find. They help you find it.\n\nThis course is beginner-friendly and designed to build your confidence. No gimmicks or shortcuts—just a clear, creative process to help you grow as a visual storyteller.\n\nThe Big Takeaway - You’re pushed to make bold creative choices, revealing your voice and unlocking visual experimentation. Each short becomes a building block, sharpening your instinct for story, composition, and meaning.\n\nThe Opportunity - A 10-second film becomes a micro-laboratory for observing your creative instincts. Like sketching, it reveals patterns and impulses you can expand into longer works.\n\nYour Future - By the time you take on bigger projects, your filmmaker identity will already be sharpened and defined.\n\nClass Topcis:\n* Theme Discovery: Learn how to identify and develop a meaningful theme that gives your ten-second film emotional depth and direction. \n* Creative Warm-Up: Begin with a playful, pressure-free approach that centers you before diving into filmmaking techniques. \n* Action-Based Ideation: Embrace an instinctive, movement-first method to find your film idea by doing, not overthinking. \n* Three-Act Microstructure: Understand how even a ten-second film can follow a full story arc with a beginning, middle, and end. \n* First Film Challenge: Create your first ten-second film using clear, simple visuals and sound to communicate your idea. \n* Directing With Intuition: Practice directing with clarity, emotional insight, and trust in your creative instincts. \n* Visual Style Development: Explore camera choices and movement to shape the tone and feeling of your story. \n* Lighting Essentials: Use simple techniques with natural or available light to enhance your film’s look and mood. \n* Edit and Sound Walkthrough: Watch real-time editing sessions to see how timing, rhythm, and sound bring a short film to life. \n* Remake and Reflect: Apply what you’ve learned by remaking your film and witnessing how much you’ve grown. \n\nTeacher's Note: \"This is my new filmmaking course. Over the years, I’ve gathered a lot of experience—not just through making films, but also by teaching them. To be hones, when I first came up with the idea for this one, I thought it was kind of silly. Maybe even a clickbait I wouldn’t normally go for. But the more I explored it, the more I realized: this might actually be a powerful idea. It was eye-opening. Even with all my experience, it sparked something new. So now I believe this could be an amazing entry point for anyone curious about filmmaking. Enjoy! :) Your teacher, Olaf de Fleur\n\nInstructor bio:\nOlaf de Fleur is an award-winning filmmaker from Iceland with over 20 years of experience and twelve feature films to his name. He has worked with acclaimed actors such as Florence Pugh (Little Women), Jonathan Pryce (Brazil), and Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad). Passionate about teaching the fundamentals of visual storytelling, Olaf helps learners build confidence and develop their creative voice. Alongside directing and writing, he teaches at film schools, speaks publicly, and offers creative coaching — always aiming to make filmmaking approachable, inspiring, and practical."

Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.This seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives."

The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.\n\nBy taking this course, you will learn: \n\n• the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization; \n• how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work; \n• how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers; \n• how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and \n• how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.\n\nAll course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners.

The experiments’ much anticipated success confirms predictions made decades earlier by Peter Higgs and others, and offers a glimpse into a universe of physics beyond the Standard Model.As Professor Peter Higgs continues his inspiring role at Edinburgh University’s School of Physics & Astronomy, the experiments at the LHC continue.\n\nThis online course introduces the theoretical tools needed to appreciate the discovery and presents the elementary particles that have been discovered at the tiniest scales ever explored. Beginning with basic concepts in classical mechanics, the story unfolds through relativity and quantum mechanics, describing forces, matter, and the unification of theories with an understanding driven by the tools of mathematics.\n\nNarrating the journey through experimental results which led to the discovery in 2012, the course invites you to learn from a team of world-class physicists at Edinburgh University. Learners participate in discussion of the consequences of the Higgs boson, to physics and cosmology, and towards a stronger understanding and new description of the universe.\n\nPhoto of Professor Higgs © Peter Tuffy, The University of Edinburgh."

When these students join our classes, they come equipped with knowledge about their own culture, which may or may not have the same norms and values as the new one they find themselves in. It is not our job, as teachers, to prove that one culture is better than another. Instead, it’s our goal to understand how culture influences one’s identity, affirm our students’ identities in the classroom, and use best practices to teach intercultural communicative competence and promote acceptance and respect for those who are different from us.This course is designed for early career teachers (0-3 years of experience) to learn about the foundations of culture and the key role that culture plays in teaching English learners. You will also learn about the connection between language and culture and how to appropriately incorporate cultural topics into instruction. We will discuss how culture is an asset in the classroom and ways to celebrate diversity with students.\n\nThroughout this course, you will watch instructional videos and interviews with experienced teachers of English learners. You will read scholarly articles, participate in discussion boards, and complete assignments that will encourage you to think about your practices as a culturally responsive educator. Finally, you will complete this course with a treasure trove of practical tips for integrating culture into your classroom. \n\nBy the end of this course, teachers will be better prepared to serve the English learners in their classrooms. They will be able to evaluate curriculum for cultural responsiveness, identify best practices for teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, reflect on their own cultural background and how that may influence expectations for students, and create a lesson plan to teach cultural knowledge."

The goal is for learners to incorporate evaluations of data quality into their process as a critical component for all projects. We sincerely hope to disseminate knowledge about total data quality to all learners, such as data scientists and quantitative analysts, who have not had sufficient training in the initial steps of the data science process that focus on data collection and evaluation of data quality. We feel that extensive knowledge of data science techniques and statistical analysis procedures will not help a quantitative research study if the data collected/gathered are not of sufficiently high quality.\n\nThis specialization will focus on the essential first steps in any type of scientific investigation using data: either generating or gathering data, understanding where the data come from, evaluating the quality of the data, and taking steps to maximize the quality of the data prior to performing any kind of statistical analysis or applying data science techniques to answer research questions. Given this focus, there will be little material on the analysis of data, which is covered in myriad existing Coursera specializations.

At the same time, how should you utilize management principles and techniques to make your church a more faithful church, rather than turning it into a secular enterprise?In this Duke Divinity+ non-credit course for church pastors and leaders, you will learn the importance of approaching church administration theologically. More specifically, you will engage church admin as church practices whose theological goals are discipleship, formation, witness, and worship. As such, church administration should be a critically important component of pastoral leadership and competence. Given such a theological understanding of church administration, we will draw upon and appropriate management excellence and know-how to serve as tools for these theological goals.\n \nAs the first course in the Duke Divinity+ Church Administration Specialization series, this course will focus on developing a theology of church administration and then applying it to time management—a huge, ongoing challenge for pastors and church leaders alike–in such a way as to reshape classic time management principles and practices into a robust Christian stewardship of time.\n\nIf you are a pastor or ministry professional in need of Continuing Education Unit (CEU) credits for your professional development, CEU credits are available for this course.  Please share your Coursera course certificate and a copy of the course description with your church denomination or employer as recognition of your earned 1.5 CEUs.\n\nThis course qualifies for 1.5 Continuing Education Unit (CEU) credits. Completion of all three courses in the \"Church Administration: Human Resources\" specialization qualifies for a total of 4.5 CEU credits."

    "content": "Le cours expose la théorie de Galois, du classique critère de non-résolubilité des équations polynomiales aux méthodes plus avancées de calcul de groupes de Galois par réduction modulo un nombre premier.Le thème général de cette théorie est l'étude des racines d'un polynôme et concerne en particulier la possibilité de les exprimer à partir des coefficients de ce polynôme. Evariste Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe ainsi à ce polynôme un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l'on appelle maintenant son groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première fois, dans ce cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en mathématiques. Son étude lui permet d'expliquer pourquoi les racines d'une équation prise au hasard ne s'expriment en général pas par des formules algébriques faisant intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un résultat démontré auparavant par Abel. Plus généralement, l'étude du groupe de Galois du polynôme permet de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe. C'est ce que l'on appelle la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d'une part la théorie des corps, d'autre part la théorie des groupes.Ce cours expliquera cette théorie en n'utilisant que des résultats de base d'algèbre linéaire. Nous étudierons d'un côté la théorie des corps, c'est-à-dire la façon dont les corps s'emboîtent les uns dans les autres, en introduisant la notion de nombre algébrique (essentiellement les racines de polynômes). D'un autre côté, nous introduirons les éléments nécessaires à l'étude des groupes de permutations. Cela nous permettra d'expliquer la théorie de Galois, non seulement dans son cadre d'origine, c'est-à-dire quand les coefficients du polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans un cadre plus général, par exemple lorsqu'on réduit ces coefficients modulo un nombre premier p.\n\nLe cours culminera avec une comparaison des groupes de Galois dans ces deux situations (« entière » et après réduction modulo p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul puissant de ces groupes.\n\nCe cours est l'occasion d'aborder des notions d'algèbre variées, essentielles dans de nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très rapidement aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables. Nous n'avons pas cherché la généralité maximale mais au contraire à aller rapidement à l'essentiel en utilisant le minimum de formalisme abstrait. Le FLOTeur intéressé sera alors armé pour aller plus loin, notamment grâce à la bibliographie ou à des cours plus avancés."
