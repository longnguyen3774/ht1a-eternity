Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms, and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa.The course examines adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in (1) water security; (2) agriculture and food security; (3) ecosystems and ecosystem services; and (4) resilient cities.",

In the field of climate change impact assessment, attention has been focused on the impact on “cities”, and reducing the damage caused by climate change to urban residents and preserving their Quality of Life (QoL) is considered an important issue.In this course, you will learn about the impact of climate change on the QoL of local residents from the perspectives of living comfort, industry, urban structures, land use/urban environment, and traffic/transportation systems. For example, how is QoL defined, and what are the effects of climate change on it? We will also focus on agriculture (fruit tree production) as an industry and learn how to understand local climate change risks. A city has various structures such as buildings and infrastructure. How will climate change affect these stocks? How does climate change affect the heat environment in urban areas, and how can we deal with it in terms of urban development?

    "content": "Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. \n\nAt the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. \n\nThe Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle – from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.\n\nIn line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? \n\nCourse Objectives:\nAt the end of this course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tRecognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities\n•\tUnderstand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change \n•\tDistinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation \n•\tExplain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning \n•\tExamine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change\n•\tDevelop a climate change plan based on participants’ city contexts",

What kind of risks need to be considered ?Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. \n\nIn this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.\n\nThis particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able :\n\n- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions\n- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies\n- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions\n- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health \n- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.\n\nYour acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.\n\nThis MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences. \n\nWe look forward to you joining us !",

The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.The course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs. We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of treatment. In the second half of the course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted.

We evaluate the many identities of the peninsula known as Christian Hispania, Jewish Sefarad, and Islamic al-Andalus. We trace the origins and trajectory of conflict between these communities (the Muslim conquest of Spain, Christian Reconquista, prohibitions blocking intermixing of peoples, and expulsions). We aim to understand conflicts within communities as well, such as the tensions between Christian Arian Visigoths and native Catholic Iberians or the fundamentalist North African Almohad Dynasty that rejected the Spanish Umayyad Caliphate’s preference for religious tolerance. We delve into an appreciation of collaboration and coexistence among these communities. We explore the unique role of the Jewish community who Muslims and Christians depended upon as political and cultural intermediaries as well as their intellectual collaborators. We find the history of how peoples attempted to create and manage viable diverse communities. As we study this history, the Honors Track will employ an investigative process (“The Historian’s Craft”) that involves viewing, reading, analyzing, and reflecting on events, peoples, places, and artifacts.",

En la primera semana, focalizaremos en presentar el estudio de los procesos básicos en psicología: ¿qué hay en la mente y cómo funciona? En primer lugar, destacaremos el abordaje empírico a los procesos mentales. Luego, expondremos la perspectiva cognitiva: la mente como procesador de información. ¿Qué significa la analogía entre la mente y una computadora (y qué no)? Finalmente, delinearemos los principales abordajes de estudio que van dando forma a la psicología cognitiva.\nEn la segunda semana, nuestro tema principal será la memoria y el pensamiento. ¿Cómo funciona la mente cuando tenemos que llegar a una conclusión en un razonamiento, tomar una decisión, resolver un problema o asignar causas a un hecho? Para eso, en primer lugar, vamos a presentar un modelo de sistemas de memoria, cuál es su función, cuáles son sus formas de adquisición y recuperación, y el formato de información con el que operan. Luego, vamos a abordar el campo de estudio del pensamiento y el planteo de dos “sistemas” o modos de procesamiento dentro del pensamiento. ¿Qué pasa cuando intentamos razonar de forma lenta y deliberada? ¿Y cuando pensamos de forma rápida y automática? Finalmente, vamos a revisar algunos de los heurísticos, sesgos y errores en el pensamiento rápido.\nEn la última semana, nos dedicaremos a estudiar qué sucede en la mente cuando hablamos o entendemos lenguaje. ¿Cómo es el procesamiento entre que tenemos una idea y la expresamos en una serie de sonidos o gráficos, llamados “letras”? ¿Y cómo es el procesamiento entre que escuchamos una serie de sonidos o vemos unos gráficos y nos hacemos una idea mental del contenido? En este módulo, plantearemos el campo de la psicolingüística y nos detendremos en los procesos de comprensión y producción. Al final veremos algunos procesos y estudios experimentales dentro de la comprensión del lenguaje.\n\nObjetivos del curso:\n• Comprender a la psicología de los procesos básicos como una disciplina científica.\n• Entender la analogía entre la mente y una computadora, y qué es un modelo en términos de arquitectura funcional.\n• Dar cuenta de las perspectivas que confluyen en la psicología cognitiva y su relevancia para ella: la psicología experimental, los modelos computacionales, la neuropsicología cognitiva, la neurociencia cognitiva.\n• Comprender un modelo de sistemas de memoria: su papel en la cognición, sus formas de adquisición y recuperación, y el formato de información con el que operan.\n• Entender el campo de estudio del pensamiento y el planteo de dos “sistemas” o modos de procesamiento dentro del pensamiento.\n• Entender qué pasa cuando intentamos razonar de forma lenta y deliberada, y cuando pensamos de forma rápida y automática.\n• Revisar algunos de los heurísticos, sesgos y errores en el pensamiento rápido.\n• Comprender el planteo del lenguaje humano como un sistema formal estructurado y reglado en el origen del abordaje cognitivo en psicolingüística.\n• Comprender el campo de estudio y abordaje de la psicolingüística cognitiva.\n• Comprender algunos de los procesos intervinientes en la comprensión del lenguaje y algunos de los estudios experimentales sobre este.",

    "content": "Counting is one of the basic mathematically related tasks we encounter on a day to day basis. The main question here is the following. If we need to count something, can we do anything better than just counting all objects one by one? Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.In this online course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.\n\nOne of the main ‘consumers’ of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life, on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area. The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop.\n\nIn the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game.\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.",

However, as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, not understanding what is fake news, misinformation or what is fact may lead to widespread public mistrust, or turn science into fuel for conspiracy theories or propaganda. Scientific findings are prone to change, making it difficult to effectively communicate them to the public. This fosters broad public skepticism towards major institutions, from the government to media to science. So, how can we communicate science effectively? And how can we rebuild trust in science? As a result, it is critical that we reconsider our science communication practices to recover public trust.This course offers a current overview of science communication. We cover a wide range of topics like fake news, mis- or disinformation, but also how to combat these practices. We explore how major stakeholders (scientists, policymakers, science communicators and citizens) can work together to improve science communication. And we tackle how people and organizations can earn and maintain public trust via effective science communication. We recommend this course to scientists, journalists, policymakers or any learners interested in science communication.\n\nMore information can be found at www.trescaproject.eu (This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No 872855.)",

These are \"signal integrity\" concepts, distilled to what you need for your Raspberry Pi projects. \n\nNow, with our knowledge of signals, Module 4 develops five rules of thumb for designing your circuits so that your high-speed signals work the first time. These five rules of thumb, combined with the experience from earlier modules, help you estimate spectral bandwidth of signals, rise time, and gain insights whether you're troubleshooting a broken design or designing something new.",

We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities.An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.\n\nWe examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.",

But Descartes already had reminded us that “comparaison n’est pas raison”, which means that comparison is not reason (or theory) by itself. \n\nThis course provides an introduction and overview of systematic comparative analyses in the social sciences and shows how to employ this method for constructive explanation and theory building. It begins with comparisons of very few cases and specific “most similar” and “most different” research designs. A major part is then devoted to the often occurring situation of dealing with a small number of highly complex cases, for example when comparing EU member states. Latin American political systems, or particular policy areas. In response to this complexity, new approaches and software have been developed in recent years (“Qualitative Comparative Analysis”, QCA, and related methods). These procedures are able to reduce complexity and to arrive at “configurational” solutions based on set theory and Boolean algebra, which are more meaningful in this context than the usual broad-based statistical methods. \nIn the last section, these methods are contrasted with more common statistical comparative methods at the macro-level of states or societies and the respective strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Some basic quantitative or qualitative methodological training is probably useful to get more out of the course, but participants with little methodological training should find no major obstacles to follow.",

There is a course long project that will build from one module to the next to create a longer final video project. The final project will be assessed by peer review. You must complete all required assessments and the final project in order to successfully pass the course. \n\nIt is important to see examples of how filmmakers use these concepts in their actual work. Most of the work samples will be small, independent productions, many will be made by students. This will introduce you to different approaches to filmmaking without a huge budget to give you a sense of the kind of work you can create on your own. The concepts covered are also used in major mainstream productions, but you can see examples of that kind of work out in the world. This course will introduce you to new ways of working that you might not have the opportunity to experience otherwise. Much of it will be experimental or avant-garde. Keep an open mind while watching these works, you will learn to be challenged by radically new techniques and approaches to filmmaking just by watching something you might not have experienced before. You are encouraged to keep a film journal during this course and write reflections on your responses to the works you’re seeing both in this course and outside. You will be asked to write reflections as assessments throughout the course. Keeping a journal is helpful so you can track the development of your own way of seeing and thinking about cinema.",

    "content": "Welcome to the course on “Concreting Practices”, a comprehensive course designed to equip learners with the basic knowledge and skills needed in the field of construction.This course comprises of 5 modules,\nModule 1 “The blending of aggregates “delves into the fundamental principles in concrete construction involves the careful combination of various types and sizes of materials to achieve a well-graded and homogeneous mixture.. The selection of aggregates, such as crushed stone, gravel, or sand, is based on factors like particle size distribution, shape, and specific engineering requirements. By blending aggregates with different properties, engineers can enhance the workability, strength, and durability of the concrete mix. Achieving the right blend ensures proper compaction and cohesion within the concrete, resulting in a cohesive, well-structured material suitable for diverse construction applications, from foundations to structural elements. The blending of aggregates is a nuanced aspect of concrete mix design, directly influencing the overall quality and functionality of the construction material.\nIn Module 2” Mix design “learners can have a detailed exploration on various process of concrete that involves the various factors to achieve the optimal combination of cement, aggregates, water, and admixtures. The primary objectives of mix design include achieving the required strength, durability, workability, and other specified properties based on the project's structural and environmental requirements. Engineers assess the properties of individual components, such as the gradation of aggregates, characteristics of cement, and the impact of admixtures, to formulate a well-balanced and cost-effective concrete mix. \nModule 3” Testing on concrete” focuses on learning its quality and performance in construction. Workability tests, such as the slump test, assess how easily concrete can be mixed, transported, and placed without segregation. Compressive strength tests, typically conducted after 28 days, measure the concrete's ability to withstand axial loads, indicating its overall strength and durability. Flexural strength tests evaluate the concrete's capacity to resist bending forces, which is crucial for structural elements like beams and slabs. Together, these tests provide a comprehensive understanding of concrete's properties, ensuring it meets the required standards for various applications. \nModule 4 “Finishing and curing “involves shaping and smoothing the concrete surface using tools like trowels, achieving desired textures or coatings for specific project needs. Curing, on the other hand, is the process of maintaining proper moisture, temperature, and time for the concrete to reach its intended strength and durability. Both processes demand careful attention and adhere to best practices to ensure the structural integrity, aesthetic appeal, and longevity of the final concrete structure.\n\nIn Module 5” Issues at Project “the learners will be able to explore construction projects involves addressing specific challenges such as bug holes, concrete placement for high-rise structures, and cold joints. To mitigate bug holes, it is crucial to use well-designed formwork, ensure proper concrete mix proportions, employ effective consolidation techniques, and implement thorough curing processes. For high-rise buildings, coordination of concrete placement, consideration of temperature control, placing the concrete with the help of Boom placers and careful curing are essential to maintain uniformity and prevent issues. Cold joints can be minimized through careful planning, proper surface preparation, and the use of bonding agents. Overall, a robust quality control plan encompassing regular inspections, comprehensive training, and collaboration among stakeholders is vital to ensure construction success. \nCollectively, the Concreting Practices provides a concise and comprehensive overview of the processes and techniques involved in the preparation, placement, and curing of concrete to ensure high-quality, durable, and structurally sound construction.\nL&T Edutech offers this unique course to make you understand the basic requirements of concreting  practices and ensure that you are ready for the industry!!!\nHappy Learning!!\nTarget Learners:\n\tPost-Graduate Students of Structural Engineering\n\tPracticing Engineers in Structural Design\n\tFaculties of Civil Engineering Domain\nPrerequisites:\n\tEngineering Mechanics\n\tFundamentals in Strength of Materials & Fluid Mechanics\n\tBasics in Concrete Technology\n\tDesign knowledge of Reinforced Concrete Elements\n\tExposure to relevant codes and standards",
