But a closer examination of the historical record reveals problems with the standard American story – how can we be a country built on freedom and equality when our Founding Fathers embedded inequality in our founding documents?Guided by the expertise of constitutional law scholar Kermit Roosevelt, this course invites students to critically examine the narratives that have shaped America, from the celebrated to the contentious. Through a deep exploration of foundational moments and overlooked histories, it lays bare the myths and realities that compose the American experience.\n \nWith a focus on the transformative periods of American history, such as the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, the Civil War, and the civil rights movement, the course scrutinizes the construction and impact of national stories. It questions how these narratives have served to unite or divide, to obscure truths, and to perpetuate injustices. By unearthing the diverse and often silenced voices from America’s past and present, Roosevelt encourages a more inclusive understanding of what it means to be American."

Desemaranhar essa complexidade é uma tarefa desafiadora, mas factível, desde que você use ferramentas adequadas. A ciência de redes nos ajuda com excelentes ferramentas conceituais e operacionais.Você aceita este chamado para a aventura? Então venha conosco aprender os fundamentos sobre redes ecológicas!\n\nSeguindo esse espírito, este curso visa ajudar pessoas interessadas em dar seus primeiros passos na análise de redes aplicada à Ecologia. Este é um curso introdutório, focado especialmente em redes de interações. Redes sociais e redes espaciais também são mencionadas, mas não de forma aprofundada, nas diversas atividades do curso.\n\nDedicando-se a essas atividades durante quatro semanas, ao final deste curso você terá adquirido uma visão geral sobre as teorias que orientam o estudo de redes ecológicas. Além disso, você será capaz de analisar gráfica- e numericamente, além de interpretar, dados de redes usando a linguagem de programação R.\n\nDessa forma, para aproveitar bem este curso você deve dominar habilidades básicas na linguagem R, além de ter familiaridade com conceitos básicos em Ecologia em nível de graduação. Mais concretamente, é importante que você já saiba como importar dados para o R, além de usar pacotes e rodar funções. Não é necessário saber construir funções personalizadas (UDFs). \n\nPara ir além, aproveitando o conteúdo extra sugerido para aprofundamento posterior ao curso, é recomendável saber ler em inglês. Vale lembrar também que a ajuda dos pacotes e funções do R é toda escrita em inglês, então dominar a leitura nesse idioma também é importante para analisar dados com mais desenvoltura.\n\nTambém é importante mencionar que diversos conceitos estatísticos são mencionados no curso. Portanto, ter conhecimento básico sobre probabilidade, distribuições de dados, medidas de tendência central e medidas de dispersão ajuda muito.\n\nSe você ainda não domina os fundamentos da linguagem R, recomendo que primeiro faça um dos excelentes cursos introdutórios disponíveis aqui na Coursera, como \"R Programming\" ou \"The R Programming Environment\". Há também aqui excelentes cursos introdutórios de estatística que podem lhe ensinar o básico sobre análise de dados.\n\nAviso: como este é um remoto no formato MOOC, construído para ser escalonado e automatizado, não há atendimento direto pelos instrutores, mas apenas interação espontânea com outros alunos nos fóruns de discussão."

You will explore why the fee-for-service model has contributed to higher costs in the U.S. healthcare system without clearly improving health outcomes. You will examine the importance of coding to reflect chronic conditions and other diagnoses accurately and how value-based care and payments utilize these measures and data. As you learn about a model to replace fee-for-service, you’ll encounter a range of payment options considered to be value-based that utilize a framework from the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network (HCP-LAN). To build on those options, you will learn how risk-adjustment, quality scores, and patient satisfaction measures are critical parts of value-based care and payment contracts. In the summative assignment, you will demonstrate your knowledge by comparing fee-for-service and value-based contracts, using specific examples to explain and justify the importance of documentation and coding, and identifying ways that risk-adjustment and patient satisfaction are incorporated into value-based care contracts.CME Accreditation\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) has approved this course for Continuing Medical Education Prescribed Credits.

    "content": "Relativism is an ancient philosophical doctrine which has recurred time and again in the history of philosophy. It has also transcended the boundaries of that discipline, for it has shaped much of the methodology in anthropology and sociology, as well as in critical theory and literary studies. While often advocated for its supposed tolerance of differences, relativism has profound consequences for how we think of reality, for the possibility of knowledge, both in the factual and in the moral domain, and may engender the practice of double standard.If a wind is hot for me and cold for you and none of us is at fault, does this mean that reality is always perspectival, or that it admits of contradictory descriptions? If a belief turns out to be justified when evaluated within a certain epistemic system (such as religion, for instance), while it turns out to be unjustified if assessed from within a different one (science, say), does relativism undermine the very possibility of knowledge? If an action can be morally permissible within an ethical system and not so within a different one, does that challenge the idea that there are moral truths and moral progress? These are some of the questions we will engage in during the course, while considering examples taken from the history of science, such as the Bellarmine-Galileo dispute, and from everyday life.\n\nThis course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning more about philosophy, along with those who are looking for strategies to combat extremism in their communities. Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life.\n\nIn this course, learners will:\n\nExplore the concept of Relativism\nDiscuss the role of Relativism in contemporary society\nIdentify common responses to Relativism\nCompare/Contrast various forms of Relativism \nRecognize how epistemic relativism can be used to explain important events in the history of science and crucial discoveries in anthropology\nCreate a presentation with your personal perspective on one of the forms of relativism"

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results."

In this course, we explain how to optimize the people, teams, projects, and finances for which you are responsible.Despite your research training, you are probably facing an urgent training gap in leadership and management skills. Scientific careers falter for non-science reasons when researchers fail to execute a scope of work: struggle to track expenses and returns substantial unspent grant funds; or run out of funds by spending on the wrong people or mismanaging the right people. Consequently, projects close with inadequate progress on aims, thus compromising successful competition for future funding.

This teaching ability can be seen as an outcome of a design approach that attends to the relationship between learning goals and activities, and the environments they are situated in. Resilient teaching approaches take into account how a dynamic learning context may require new forms of interactions between teachers, students, content, and tools. Additionally, they necessitate the capacity to rethink the design of learning experiences based on a nuanced understanding of context.The course is designed with higher education faculty, lecturers, and graduate student instructors in mind, but may also be applicable to educators in a wide variety of instructional environments. The course is aimed at participants who may be asked to rethink how they teach in the immediate or near future due to the ever-changing circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the creation of this course is motivated by the current crisis, we expect it will remain relevant to instructors who are faced with disruptions and change to their teaching for any number of reasons and must quickly adapt their course designs.\n\nTo support learning and reflection, we are introducing a new journaling tool within the course that provides a place for participants to reflect on their own experiences. To support community growth, participants can choose to share their journal entries with the wider course community in an interactive gallery space."

It is divided into two parts: (1) theoretical lectures will cover the basis of RF and mmWave Circuit Design; and (2) design labs will include simulation and implementation of these circuits.\nThe design labs are completely optional for obtaining the certificate, but they are recommended because they allow students to put into practice all the acquired theoretical knowledge, and of course, implementing the circuits is where all the fun is! The students will be able to do 70% of the design labs using simulation tools, which already offers a great learning experience. The other 30% will require students to either get access to an electronics lab or to purchase a few off-the-shelf components. But ultimately, this would allow students to design and build their own transceiver at home!\nThe course contains theoretical video classes with examples, quizzes, and an entire set of simulation files, step-by-step procedures, recorded data of real-life circuits, and solution videos so that students can learn from and build even better circuits."

It is a cornerstone notion for businesses and organizations, but also for nation states and their many levels of government. And even for individuals, risk and the avoidance or embracing thereof, is a key theme.The course Risk in Modern Society sheds light on the broad concept of risk. In five distinctive weeks, this course closely examines various types of safety and security risks, and how these are perceived and dealt with in a wide array of professional and academic fields, ranging from criminology, counter-terrorism and cyber security, to philosophy, safety and medical science. Developed in collaboration with scholars from three universities (Leiden, Delft and Erasmus), this course will search for answers to questions such as: “what is risk?”, “how do we study and deal with risk?”, “does ‘perceived risk’ correspond to 'real' risk?”, and “how should we deal with societal perceptions of risk, safety and security?"

This domain sets the foundation for the entire course; terms defined here will be used in this book and in your day-to-day career. Risk management is one of the most complicated and important topics in information security, and this chapter does not pretend to cover all the different elements pertaining to it, but it provides a high-level glimpse of the essential concepts of this vital function.  ​\n\nIn the healthcare industry, the importance of adopting a risk management approach is even more crucial, due to the sensitive nature of the information. Data sharing can, in many cases, be a matter of life and death in the healthcare industry. However, patient safety is not the only objective. Saving someone's life only to have their most sensitive secrets leaked to unauthorized parties is counterproductive. Hence, the security and privacy practitioner must balance the clinical need for information and the patient's rightful expectation of privacy.  ​\n\nLike other industries, the healthcare industry relies on technology to improve operations and patient care. In many cases, these technologies come with associated risks that must be considered.

Both books describe God’s mercy and God’s justice. In other ways, however, they differ sharply. The Qur’an insists that God has sent a new prophet: Muhammad. It also criticizes the teaching, and the behavior, of Jews and Christians. In Sacred Texts in Dialogue, we will explore the common points, and stark differences, between the Bible and the Qur’an. \n\nSacred Texts in Dialogue assumes no previous knowledge of the Bible or the Qur’an. Its approach is academic: students will learn about the world in which the Bible developed (both the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and the New Testament), and the world in which the Qur’an developed centuries later. At the same time, learners will discover the place that each scripture has in the religious life of believers. We will explore the intense devotion that believers have to the Bible and the Qur’an, and see how that devotion shapes society, religion, and politics in our world today.\n\nUpon the successful completion of this program, the participant will receive a document certifying that the participant completed the program. The document will not qualify as an academic credential, and the recipient will not earn any academic credits [or receive a transcript] from the University of Notre Dame in connection with the program. Participants in the program are not students at the University of Notre Dame, and completion of the program does not qualify any participant for status as an alumnus of the University of Notre Dame."

Learning from actual experience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior. We will cover intuitively simple but powerful Monte Carlo methods, and temporal difference learning methods including Q-learning. We will wrap up this course investigating how we can get the best of both worlds: algorithms that can combine model-based planning (similar to dynamic programming) and temporal difference updates to radically accelerate learning.By the end of this course you will be able to:\n \n- Understand Temporal-Difference learning and Monte Carlo as two strategies for estimating value functions from sampled experience\n- Understand the importance of exploration, when using sampled experience rather than dynamic programming sweeps within a model\n- Understand the connections between Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming and TD. \n- Implement and apply the TD algorithm, for estimating value functions\n- Implement and apply Expected Sarsa and Q-learning (two TD methods for control) \n- Understand the difference between on-policy and off-policy control\n- Understand planning with simulated experience (as opposed to classic planning strategies)\n- Implement a model-based approach to RL, called Dyna, which uses simulated experience \n- Conduct an empirical study to see the improvements in sample efficiency when using Dyna"

Samples can be more carefully selected based on a researcher’s judgment, but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors.  Samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways, using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control.  It is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed in this course.  We will examine simple random sampling that can be used for sampling persons or records, cluster sampling that can be used to sample groups of persons or records or networks, stratification which can be applied to simple random and cluster samples, systematic selection, and stratified multistage samples.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel paradigm. We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering.Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n- reason about task and data parallel programs,\n- express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,\n- competently microbenchmark parallel code,\n- write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience.

How confident are we that climate change is anthropogenic? Are we heading for a climate catastrophe? Why are greenhouse gases associated with global warming? What options do we have to cope with these facts? Which of the many proposals are realistic, and which are just wishful thinking? By the end of this course, you will have the necessary conceptual tools to provide your own answers to these questions.\n\nThis MOOC is divided into four modules. With the first two you will understand how scientists measure climate and its evolution, how climate models work and how greenhouse gases within the atmosphere play a central role in determining the climate. The last two modules introduce the main technologies that can be used to reduce carbon emissions and carbon concentration in the atmosphere, and, in the light of the facts explained in the first part of the course, explain how these technologies can be best combined.\n\nThe MOOC is for those who want to understand not only the basics of climate-change science, but also what we can really and effectively do to curb the present trend in the planet’s temperatures.

You’ll learn to break down the creative process into components, and you’ll discover a structured process that allows you to produce a polished and pitch-ready script in just a few weeks. Completing this project will increase your confidence in your ideas and abilities, and you’ll feel prepared to pitch your first script and get started on your next. \n\nHere is a link to a trailer for the course. To view the trailer, please copy and paste the link into your browser.\nhttps://vimeo.com/423035246/6b3c18c4c5\n\nThis is a course designed to tap into your creativity and is based in \"Active Learning\". Most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your direct way of teaching this course. It was encouraging for us all to creatively flow and find our own voice in writing and developing our scripts. This aspect was very important to me.\" Ingrid\n\nThe course curriculum is simple: you’ll write, revise your work, and share feedback with your peers. \n\nI am a proponent of Experiential Learning (active learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won’t \"show\" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.\n\n“David's lecture style for this course is inspired. The videos are succinct and engaging. When I watch the lectures I feel David’s sincere desire for me to create something truly amazing. He is teaching us how to write a script, and he is providing wisdom and tools that will help us do so in a compelling way - by writing; not by watching him talk at us.” - A R Adamson\n\nWhat you’ll need to get started:\n\nTo begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.\n\nLearner Review: \"I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David's guidance is spot on, he's his own compelling story teller, he gives you enough, and then you have to figure it out, make it happen, WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! \"\n\nIf you have any concerns regarding the protection of your original work, Coursera's privacy policy protects the learner's IP and you are indeed the sole owners of your work.\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: This is a ‘project-centered course’, which means it is designed specifically to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share. \n\nTime: 1-2 hours of study,  30+ hours of active project work"
