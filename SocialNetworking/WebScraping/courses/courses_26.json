Allied Health Professionals must be committed to the key attributes of professionalism and strive to reflect this within the delivery of patient-centered, safe, and effective care. “Professionalism” is a broad term which reflects many different skills and abilities. For an individual to exhibit professionalism, they must be armed with specific skills and abilities that do not always show up within certification requirements, or even within career training curriculum.  Soft skills are hard to measure and are typically less well-defined than hard skills. However, soft skills are what set many job candidates apart. Professionalism is not just what one knows. It is how one does their job, how one behaves, and how one comes across as they interact with others.The purpose of this course is to support students with soft skills training that will provide the tools needed to demonstrate a higher level of professionalism on the job. Key components of the course focus on patient interaction, proper office behavior, medical ethics, diversity and cultural bias, emotional strength, professional appearance, and communication. The course maintains a focus on the key attributes that are true markers of professionalism.\n\nThis course was created with input from healthcare professionals working in the field, healthcare employers that hire our graduates, professional educators, and even former MedCerts students. The end-result is a collection of modules that touch on the soft skills that are truly important in the real world of allied healthcare. In this course, students are engaged through scenario-based learning that allows for real interaction with virtual coworkers and patients. Additionally, game-based activities keep students engaged and entertained throughout their learning journey.",

I have been studying prostate cancer and treating patients with prostate cancer for over 25 years.Over 1,000,000 men worldwide and 230,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Three hundred thousand men worldwide and 30,000 men in the US are dying from prostate cancer every year. As people live longer, the incidence of prostate cancer is rising worldwide and prostate cancer continues to be a major health problem. Thanks to years of dedication and commitment to research we’ve made enormous advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, But there is still a lot of work to be done. In this Understanding Prostate Cancer course, I will provide an introduction to the biology of prostate cancer as well as how it is identified and treated at various stages of the disease. \n\nI've put together this course in order to introduce you to the essentials of prostate cancer.\n\nBy the time you finish this course you'll be able to\n\tDefine risk factors for prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand current prostate cancer screening guidelines\n\tUnderstand prostate cancer staging\n\tUnderstand treatments for localized prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand treatments for advanced prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand treatments to alleviate the symptoms caused by prostate cancer\n\nThis Understanding Prostate Cancer Course should be helpful to anyone who wants to develop a deeper understanding of prostate cancer biology and treatment.  It should be useful to students who are interested in a deeper understanding of the science of cancer. It should also be helpful to health care providers, data managers, and educators who wish to develop a better understanding of prostate cancer and how it affects individuals.  The course is not designed for patients seeking treatment guidance. For those of you who might be thinking about a career in cancer research or patient care, I hope this course will inspire you to pursue that path! The course is divided into five modules organized to facilitate learning.\n\nI'm glad that you decided to join this course. I hope that you will develop a basic understanding of prostate cancer. I hope that it will help you in whatever field you work.

En este curso, desde la perspectiva de las psicologías del condicionamiento, vamos a explorar cómo nuestros cuerpos aprenden a regular sus respuestas fisiológicas a partir de los estímulos del ambiente (condicionamiento clásico) y cómo nuestras conductas aumentan, disminuyen y se transforman en hábitos o adicciones a partir de sus consecuencias (condicionamiento operante).

    "content": "Quality has been a thorny issue for the software development industry. From early programs to modern applications, software has always been prone to bugs- defects that shouldn’t be there yet often make their way into production, diminishing user experience and frustrating developers. Ensuring that the final product works as expected is the core responsibility of QA practices and processes. However, this is easier said than done. The QA function is often misunderstood and forgotten, especially in agile environment where principles like “progress over perfection” and “fail fast to learn fast” made practitioners shift their focus away from thoughtful quality management.Managing quality is not about eliminating every bug and issue. It may not even be possible. Instead, it’s about building software development processes that are able to deliver the expected results which the team commits to. Predictability, as a key measure of quality, allows teams to adjust their throughput by consciously deciding on the acceptable quality levels for their final products.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore how to design and structure an effective quality process in the modern agile team through collaboration and automation. We will look at tools and techniques that work; and combine them with meaningful measures, which will allow us not only position QA function appropriately within the agile delivery process but also improve and fine-tune it over time \n\nThis course is designed for professionals involved in ensuring software quality within agile environments. It is ideal for software testers, quality engineers, developers, scrum masters, agile coaches, and team managers who are engaged in or responsible for agile development processes. Whether you’re directly testing code or guiding agile delivery practices, this course equips you with the tools and strategies to elevate quality assurance in your team.\n\nTo fully benefit from this course, learners should have a foundational understanding of the software development lifecycle, software testing principles, and agile methodologies. Prior exposure to agile project environments will help contextualize the QA concepts presented and allow for easier application of best practices in real-world scenarios.\n\nBy the end of the course, learners will be able to clearly define the role of QA in agile development and integrate quality practices from the earliest stages of the software lifecycle. They’ll learn to scope effective automation strategies and use data insights to continuously refine the QA process. These skills will help teams deliver higher-quality software with greater predictability and alignment to user expectations.",

    "content": "Welcome to this massive open online course (MOOC) about Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Please read the points below before you start the course. This will help you prepare well for the course and attend it properly. It will also help you determine if the course offers the knowledge and skills you are looking for.What can you do with QCA?\n•\tQCA is a comparative method that is mainly used in the social sciences for the assessment of cause-effect relations (i.e. causation). \n•\tQCA is relevant for researchers who normally work with qualitative methods and are looking for a more systematic way of comparing and assessing cases. \n•\tQCA is also useful for quantitative researchers who like to assess alternative (more complex) aspects of causation, such as how factors work together in producing an effect.\n•\tQCA can be used for the analysis of cases on all levels: macro (e.g. countries), meso (e.g. organizations) and micro (e.g. individuals).\n•\tQCA is mostly used for research of small- and medium-sized samples and populations (10-100 cases), but it can also be used for larger groups. Ideally, the number of cases is at least 10. QCA cannot be used if you are doing an in-depth study of one case.\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n•\tThe course is designed for people who have no or little experience with QCA.\n•\tAfter the course you will understand the methodological foundations of QCA. \n•\tAfter the course you will know how to conduct a basic QCA study by yourself. \n\nHow is this course organized?\n•\tThe MOOC takes five weeks. The specific learning objectives and activities per week are mentioned in appendix A of the course guide. Please find the course guide under Resources in the main menu. \n•\tThe learning objectives with regard to understanding the foundations of QCA and practically conducting a QCA study are pursued throughout the course. However, week 1 focuses more on the general analytic foundations, and weeks 2 to 5 are more about the practical aspects of a QCA study.\n•\tThe activities of the course include watching the videos, consulting supplementary material where necessary, and doing assignments. The activities should be done in that order: first watch the videos; then consult supplementary material (if desired) for more details and examples; then do the assignments.\n•\tThere are 10 assignments. Appendix A in the course guide states the estimated time needed to make the assignments and how the assignments are graded. Only assignments 1 to 6 and 8 are mandatory. These 7 mandatory assignments must be completed successfully to pass the course.\n•\tMaking the assignments successfully is one condition for receiving a course certificate. Further information about receiving a course certificate can be found here: https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate \n\nAbout the supplementary material\n•\tThe course can be followed by watching the videos. It is not absolutely necessary yet recommended to study the supplementary reading material (as mentioned in the course guide) for further details and examples. Further, because some of the covered topics are quite technical (particularly topics in weeks 3 and 4 of the course), we provide several worked examples that supplement the videos by offering more specific illustrations and explanation. These worked examples can be found under Resources in the main menu.\n•\tNote that the supplementary readings are mostly not freely available. Books have to be bought or might be available in a university library; journal publications have to be ordered online or are accessible via a university license.\n•\tThe textbook by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) functions as the primary reference for further information on the topics that are covered in the MOOC. Appendix A in the course guide mentions which chapters in that book can be consulted for which week of the course.\n•\tThe publication by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) is comprehensive and detailed, and covers almost all topics discussed in the MOOC. However, for further study, appendix A in the course guide also mentions some additional supplementary literature.\n•\tPlease find the full list of references for all citations (mentioned in this course guide, in the MOOC, and in the assignments) in appendix B of the course guide.",

    "content": "This course gives you access to basic tools and concepts to understand research articles and books on modern quantum optics. You will learn about quantization of light, formalism to describe quantum states of light without any classical analogue, and observables allowing one to demonstrate typical quantum properties of these states. These tools will be applied to the emblematic case of a one-photon wave packet, which behaves both as a particle and a wave. Wave-particle duality is a great quantum mystery in the  words of Richard Feynman. You will be able to fully appreciate real experiments demonstrating wave-particle duality for a single photon, and applications to quantum technologies based on single photon sources, which are now commercially available. The tools presented in this course will be widely used in our second quantum optics course, which will present more advanced topics such as entanglement, interaction of quantized light with matter, squeezed light, etc...So if you have a good knowledge in basic quantum mechanics and classical electromagnetism, but always wanted to know:\n•\thow to go from classical electromagnetism to quantized radiation,\n•\thow the concept of photon emerges,\n•\thow a unified formalism is able to describe apparently contradictory behaviors observed in quantum optics labs,\n•\thow creative physicists and engineers have invented totally new technologies based on quantum properties of light,\nthen this course is for you.",

All the examples were taken in single photons phenomena, including applications to quantum technologies.In the same spirit, \"Quantum Optics 2, Two photons and more\", will allow learners to use the Quantum Optics formalism to  describe entangled photon, a unique feature at the root of the second quantum revolution and its applications to quantum technologies. Learners will also discover how the Quantum Optics formalism allows one to describe classical light, either coherent such as laser light, or incoherent such as thermal radiation. Using a many photons description, it is possible to derive the so-called Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which applies to classical light, and to understand how new kinds of quantum states of light, such as squeezed states of light, allow one to beat the SQL, one of the achievements of quantum metrology. Several examples of Quantum Technologies based on entangled photons will be presented, firstly in quantum communication, in particular Quantum Teleportation and Quantum Cryptography. Quantum Computing and Quantum Simulation will also be presented, including some insights into the recently proposed Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, which raises a serious hope to demonstrate, in a near future, the actively searched quantum advantage, ie, the possibility to effect calculations exponentially faster than with classical computers.",

Issues of race and ethnicity are examined across different ethno-cultural traditions in order to interweave diverse experiences into a larger synthesis of the meaning of race and ethnicity in American life. In this course, we conceive of “race” and “diversity” as references to the entire American population, even as we recognize that different groups have unique historical experiences resulting in distinctive and even fundamental cultural differences. We treat race and ethnicity as dynamic, complex ideological and cultural processes that shape all social institutions, belief systems, inter-group relationships, and individual experiences.",
