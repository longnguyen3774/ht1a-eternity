    "content": "Organometallic Catalysis in Sustainable Chemistry offers foundational knowledge to tackle sustainability challenges from a chemical perspective, primarily through homogeneous organometallic catalysis. The course centers around dihydrogen (H₂) as the key sustainability molecule, utilizing it in various roles, such as in processes that produce or consume dihydrogen. With these tools, the course explores methods for storing H₂, upgrading biomass, and utilizing CO₂ to create industrially valuable commodity chemicals.Highly beneficial and engaging for students, the course follows a logical progression. It starts with the basics of organometallic chemistry and then applies this knowledge to catalysis, with a focus on sustainability. By completing the course, students will gain essential tools to independently explore organometallic catalysis in sustainable chemistry.\n\nThis course is designed for students or professionals, typically with a Bachelor's degree in chemistry or equivalent relevant industrial experience, who have an interest in homogeneous catalysis and sustainability.",

At the end of this week, you will have a better understanding of the cosmos and your place in it.\n\nWeek 3 - Space exploration can happen in two ways. By viewing there and going there. This week we will explore both methods. Our first lesson is with Dr. Paul Hayne and Dr. Carolyn Crow on Space Exploration-Going There. We will look at the stages of exploration and how the science changes at each point. Next, we will meet Dr. Kristy Tiampo as we discuss Space Exploration-Viewing There. We will dive deep into remote sensing work around Earth and how that technique of viewing can be applied throughout the cosmos.\n\nWeek 4 - This week, we will discuss some of the great science being conducted in the cosmos as well as our species search life elsewhere in the universe. We have three lessons this week. The first two are in two parts. Extending Science Beyond Earth. In Part 1, we meet Dr. Nick Schneider and discuss how the different wavelengths of light have allowed us to understand other planets like Mars but also Earth. In Part 2, we meet Dr. Dave Brain and discuss what we have learned about other planets in our solar system and compare those discoveries with our home planet.
