    "content": "Do we truly think that we have lived for ourselves? Perhaps we have lived for money, love, fame, family and pride etc.? Therefore, we don’t seem to be satisfied even though we are full of those things. It is because that we don’t know ourselves.Eric Fromm talked about human nature as two modes of being: “To Have” and “To Be”.  If we are “Having” the nature of possessions, we are not satisfied, and feel empty and futile. Then, how can we be “Being” the nature of our inner-selves?\n\nSometimes, we happened to be aware of this “Being” nature and try to change ourselves, but fail. But, because of our daily routines, it’s easily forgotten. And more it is hard to escape from our unwanted minds controlling us.\n\nFrom now on, let us reflect on ourselves and look at our minds leading up to today! Don’t we achieve our goals after knowing ourselves? And let us find the “Being” nature of our original selves after escaping from the minds restraining and controlling us.\n\nIn this lecture, the definition and principle of the mind are explained in simple and clear ways. You can make sure and practice the methodology of finding the true original mind of inner-self by escaping from the false mind of possession. \n\nSelf-reflection is the first step to meditate. You can know yourselves most objectively through meditation and you will realize that all the thoughts and actions are due to your minds which are nonexistent and false. If you throw away the false mind, you will find the true mind.\n\nMeditation is now world-wide sensation. There are many research reports that show people can be leaders if you have a habit of self-reflection through meditation. Now meditation at school and the workplace are popular.\n\nHappiness is having no worries. You can really relax yourself if there is no bundle of thoughts and you can be successful when you know yourself truly. Worries come from the memorized thoughts of the false mind. Your inner potential of positive power are revealed, your peaceful and happiest mind will be in your mind, and you can live the life you wanted through meditation.\n\nThis method of meditation is very practical and everybody can follow the methodology. As an engineer, I will guide you step by step to practice this meditation. I am sure that this lecture becomes a turning point in your life."

This generally implies, with some exceptions, that each organism has two parents.\n\nThis description might sound trivial it is however not at all. Before the appearance of sex, organisms reproduced solely by division. One cell divided into two cells, no partners, no fusion, just simple cell division. This simple cell division is still here. In fact, the trillions of cells that make up your body are all the descendants of a single cell that underwent several dozens of cell divisions. Surprisingly, most multicellular, as well as, many unicellular organisms reproduce by sex. We might take it thus for granted but this course will show you that it is a rather peculiar and enigmatic process.\n\nThis course will provide you with the necessary tools to understand how sex works and to marvel at its mysteries. We will start by meeting the actors of this greatest drama in their native habitats, from ancient bacteria that live in thermal geysers in Yellowstone national park to the great mammals that roam the African savanna. We will also briefly discuss the history of life on earth and its contemporary state.\n\nThe second unit defines the rules of the game explaining the mechanisms of heredity and evolution.\n\nThe third unit focuses on meiosis, the fundamental and conserved molecular event that forms the basis of sex. And that might have led to the appearance of sex in the first place. We will also explain the fertility cycle and male and female germ cell development. The fourth unit describes the striking variability of sex determination throughout the animal kingdom. We will discuss the requirement for two genders and their considerable cost. Finally, we will dive in the gulf of Aqaba to meet organisms that are both male and female either at the same, or at different times.\n\nSex requires cooperation between two individuals – a male and a female – that are in a basic conflict of interest. Furthermore, males and females compete among themselves. This complex network of cooperation and conflict forms the fascinating plot we will tell in the fifth unit that will discuss the patterns of reproduction and social behavior of different animals – corals, insects, spiders, fish, birds, and mammals. We will be intrigued to discover that the same basic conflict is resolved by a huge range of approaches, from altruistic behavior all the way to open warfare and infanticide.\n\nThe sixth unit takes us to fertilization and beyond. Starting at an IVF clinic we follow embryonic development throughout the animal kingdom from insects to tadpoles and humans.\n\nThe seventh unit is dedicated to flowering plants that made our world colorful, sweet-smelling and tasty and that produce almost all animal food."

We will also discusses factors that affect the emerging youth problems and how social workers deal with such situation.\n\nIn addition, we will also explore the significance of youth welfare policy and its impact on the social work practices. We’ll expand upon and discuss factors that affect the problems as well as prevention and consultation from social work perspective. The course will cover perspective from around the world.\n\nIn response to the SDG (Sustainable development goals) initiative project, this course is updated with English subtitle. Foreign students are welcomed to join us. However, the course now only features partial translation. Various resources will be updated with English translation in the future. Moreover, we’ve also added examples of program implementation to our homework. Students are encouraged to participate in related projects extend learning beyond the scope of this course.\n\n\nThe objectives of the course are:\n1) To have proper understanding of obstacles faced when implementing youth welfare and rights.\n2) To establish the correct concept of youth group, and dispel related myths and stereotypes.\n3) To have the basic knowledge of social work to empathize and assist in dealing with issues related to the welfare of youth. \n4) To motivate students in protecting youth rights.\n\nCourse format 　　\nThis course is consisted of lecture videos, featuring practitioners experience sharing, case analysis, mid-course discussion. Linking students’ personal experience with knowledge provided in this course. In addition, students must also complete the online discussion and upload homework, and at least review and comment on two other students’ homework.\n\nRecommended background\nStudents who study this course do not need to have a professional foundation as long as they have basic reading and writing skills and are interested in youth welfare, rights and social work methods."

    "content": "If we are to make sense of the future of humanity, we must understand the future of the city. For some scholars the 21st century globe will see the most significant change of human history - the move of most of the world to live in cities - a planetary urbanism that has changed the way we live globally, the way we organise ourselves economically and the impact humanity has on our environment in an age that we consequently now describe as the Anthropocene.Most of the urban growth on the planet will be in the global South and this is where we concentrate the attention of this course, drawing on the work of a five-year programme known as PEAK Urban, involving a collaboration of researchers from China, Colombia, India, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe PEAK Urban programme aims to aid decision-making on urban futures by:\n•\tGenerating new research grounded in the logic of urban complexity;\n•\tFostering the next generation of leaders that draw on different perspectives and backgrounds to address the greatest urban challenges of the 21st century;\n•\tGrowing the capacity of cities to understand and plan their own future.\n\nShaping Urban Futures aims to demonstrate how complementary research projects have applied the PEAK Urban framework – Prediction, Emergence, Adoption and Knowledge – to uncover interrelated issues of health, climate change, migration and informality in places that will face the biggest challenges from rapid unplanned urbanisation.\n\nThis course consists of 6 modules, with an Introduction and a Closing module sandwiching 4 core modules. Each module involves around 5-6 hours of learning. To get the best out of the course, learners are encouraged to view all the video lectures and conversations, go through other learning material, work on all the assignments and assessments, and participate in discussions in a constructive and respectful manner. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tRecognise the new urban sciences that are driving our understanding of urbanisation across the world\n•\tExamine carefully how we should understand how to trace, examine and explore the ways new social, economic and environmental changes emerge and reshape the working of the city\n•\tVisualise how technological change is adopted, adapted and deployed differently in variable city contexts\n•\tUnderstand how best to intervene in urban futures through sharing urban experiences and contributing to the coproduction of knowledge to enrich and strengthen knowledge exchange in cities\n\nThis course is designed principally for people working in cities who want to make a difference and for all urban scholars, from early career researchers to veteran urbanists and everyone in between. This course will also hopefully inspire workers in local government, community organisations and the private sector as well as urban scholars to build upon the experiences of a global network to develop their own methods and frames to view, interpret and define urban changes in their local geographies and contexts."

    "content": "Our life is fine-controlled by various molecules in cells. Different types of molecules include macromolecules (e.g., protein, nucleic acid) and small molecules. In addition to classical views of central dogma, emerging roles of small molecules called metaboites have been recently proposed to significantly impact biological events. Metabolites are contiuously and dynamically produced by different metabolic pathways, thus playing key roles in energy metabolism as well as macromolecular biosynthesis/degradation. Accumulating evidence clearly suggests that certain types of metabolites exert signaling actions through interactions with macromolecules. Compared to other protein-protein and nucleic acid-protein interactions, metabolite-protein interactions appear significant in living cells, therby mediating specific actions in regulating target protein functions and activities.This 6 week-course will give you a solid introduction to the basic fundamentals of metabolite-mediated cell signaling. I will first define the concept of metabolites and introduces major types of molceular interactions. Throughout 6 weeks, we will study biochemical basis of metabolite actions in cell signaling. In particular, we will study interesting examples of how endogenous small molecules intreact with target proteins and control their functions. These major topics will be explained in the context of human health and disease such as cancer and inflammtion. Everyone appreciates that cell signaling is essential for sustaining life. How can you explain the action of noxious gases like nitric oxide in controlling blood pressure? What can be the fundamental mode of energy metabolites in modulating gene expression? Have you ever thought about ways of how our gut microbiota can influence our body? By studying signaling actions of metabolites, we can better understand the complex but wonderful nature of our cellular signaling system, further identifying novel ways to manage major human disease."

The general aspects of the photovoltaic field are treated in \"Photovoltaic Solar Energy\". And the detailed description of the crystalline silicon solar cells can be found in \"Physics of Silicon Solar Cells\".\n\nAfter a brief presentation of solar cells operation, thin film semiconductors are described here. The general properties of disordered and crystalline semiconductors are found very different, in particular in terms of band structure and doping mechanisms. Silicon thin films, generally less than 1 µm thick, are deposited from silane plasma leading to hydrogen incorporation. The growth mechanisms are discussed, in particular the capability to prepare partially crystallized thin films which appear as a mixture of nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous tissue.\n\nThe consequences of the semiconductor properties on solar cells behavior are reviewed. The optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon are complementary. Thus the plasma process is particularly well adapted to the preparation of multijunctions, with conversion efficiencies around 13-15 %. Furthermore plasma processes allow to prepare solar cells in large area on glass or flexible substrates.\n\nFinally, it is shown that crystalline and amorphous silicon materials can be combine into heterojunctions solar cells with high efficiency conversion (about 25 %).\n\n**This course is part of a series of 3**\nPhotovoltaic solar energy (https://www.coursera.org/learn/photovoltaic-solar-energy/)\nPhysics of silicon solar cells (https://www.coursera.org/learn/physics-silicon-solar-cells/)\nSilicon thin film solar cells"

Simulation modeling allows us to explore various outcomes and protect personal or business interests against unwanted outcomes.  We can model uncertainties by using the concepts of probability and stepwise thinking.  Stepwise thinking allows us to break down the problem in smaller components, explore dependencies between related events and allows us to focus on aspects of problem that are prone to changes due to future uncertainties.\n\nThe course will introduce you to advanced Excel techniques to model and execute simulation models.  Many of the Excel techniques learned in the course will be useful beyond simulation modeling.  We will learn both Monte Carlo simulation techniques where overall outcome is of primary interest and discrete event simulation where intermediate dependencies between related events might be of interest.  The course will introduce you to several practical issues in simulation modeling that are normally not covered in textbooks.  The course uses a few running examples throughout the course to demonstrate concepts and provide concrete modeling examples.  \n\nAfter taking the course a student will be able to develop fairly advanced simulation models to explore fairly broad range of business environments and outcomes."

    "content": "This particular course entitled “Single-Phase Pipe Hydraulics & Pipe Sizing” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at predicting the optimum pipe diameter of the piping system to meet the given process requirement when it is subjected to a single-phase fluid flow. Here, the piping system is either a single-path piping system or a multiple-path piping system. To achieve the single-point objective, i.e., the Sizing of the Ping System, essential concepts of single-phase fluid flow through pipes are covered, essential mathematical expressions are derived to understand the intricacy of the single-phase phenomena, and the importance of each term in governing equations is explained.To begin with, the key role of the pipe in transporting the fluid from the source to the destination is explained by citing numerous applications. The pipes may be subjected to single-phase fluid flow or multi-phase flow. This course is dedicated to single-phase hydraulics. In most practical situations, process flow conditions such as fluid flow rate and operating conditions are the input to determine the pipe diameter. However, the pressure drop is a constraint. To meet the pressure drop constraint for the given process flow conditions, the designer must be thorough with the dynamics of single-phase fluid flow in straight pipes, pipe fittings, valves, etc. Sigle-phase fluid flow phenomena are well established and hence the pressure drop in a piping system can be predicted accurately. \nIn single-phase fluid flow, irrespective of the type of the fluid, i.e., gas or liquid, the flow resistance factor, known as friction factor depends on the Reynolds Number along with other important parameters.  Indeed, the Reynolds Number decides the type of flow regime, i.e., laminar or turbulent. The pressure drop is directly proportional to the length of the pipe and the square of the fluid velocity or mass flux, and interestingly, the pressure drop is inversely proportional to the pipe diameter. This means that as the diameter increases, the pressure drop decreases. The constant of proportionality is the friction factor. This concept behind pipe hydraulics is brought up very well in this course. The friction factor for turbulent flow is different from laminar flow. The former is a function of the Reynolds number and relative roughness of the pipe whereas the latter is the function of only Reynolds number.  Various friction factor correlations for turbulent flow along with their applicability are available and presented in this course.  The pressure drop in pipes is considered as the skin frictional pressure drop. However, the pressure drop in pipe fittings is mostly due to the eddies formation in the zones where the fluid separates from the pipe wall and fluid mixing at locations downstream of the pipe. These head losses are considered minor losses, however, in some cases, they are significant when compared with the major head losses offered by the straight pipes. Minor losses can be determined by considering either the loss coefficients or equivalent lengths of various pipe fittings. The detailed discussion and demonstration of pressure drop predictions are well covered in this course.\nThis course is not limited to single-path single-phase pipe hydraulics. Multiple-path piping systems popularly known as piping networks are also considered and the prediction of pressure drop in these networks is demonstrated by using well-accepted methodologies. Pressure drop calculation in the header and branching pipelines, when they are connected to various fluid sources, is discussed in this course. Though piping systems are operated at a steady state most of the time, they are also subjected to transients during startup and shutdown operations. Piping systems are also subjected to transients due to oscillatory fluid flow, water hammer, and steam hammer. These transients and the pressure rise due to the water hammer are well covered in this course. Finally, the hydraulics of liquid flow in inclined pipes under gravity is also covered in this particular course."

Personal relevance is emphasized by the fact that the single best predictor of daytime performance is the quality of the previous night's sleep. The brain actively generates sleep, and the first section of the course is an overview of the neurobiological basis of sleep control. The course provides cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances such as alcohol, ,caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The second section of the course covers sleep-dependent changes in physiology and sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic control. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote obesity. Deaths due to all causes are most frequent between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m., and this second section of the class highlights the relevance of sleep for preventive medicine. The societal relevance of sleep will be considered in the final section of the class. In an increasingly complex and technologically oriented society, operator-error by one individual can have a disastrous negative impact on public health and safety.  Fatigue-related performance decrements are known to have contributed as causal factors to nuclear power plant failures, transportation disasters, and medical errors."

We prioritize work, school, socializing, sports, screen time – just about everything – over sleep. Sleep is viewed as compressible, something that can be made up at any time, but rarely is. Most believe this poses little risk. Unfortunately, they could not be more wrong.The truth is that an adequate amount of good-quality sleep is critical to good health. Lack of sleep leads to deadly crashes, reduces productivity, and harms quality of life. Insufficient or disordered sleep can increase risk for anxiety, depression, heart attack, stroke, arrhythmia, heart failure, and early death. This Teach-Out can be your first step in doing something about sleep deprivation.\n\nThis Teach-Out will answer:\n- What are the health implications of the evolving sleep deprivation epidemic?\n- Why has sleep become undervalued in society, and what cultural shifts are necessary to re-prioritize it?\n- How does technology and modern lifestyle contribute to widespread sleep issues?\n- What effective methods can individuals adopt to improve their sleep quality?\n- How can communities and organizations facilitate better sleep habits for the general population?\n\nJoin us as we delve into the world of sleep and emerge with a new perspective on the importance of rest. You'll not only gain deeper insight into the sleep deprivation crisis but also learn how you can take tangible steps to reclaim the restorative power of sleep for yourself and others."

While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics."

None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.\n\nMost important, you’ll have a lot of fun."

The topics of Course 4 span four weeks and nine lessons with 36 learning objectives. This course contains some of my most favorite aha moments in the the entire specialization. I hope that you find them and that they impact you in a positive way. We will discuss how space is communicated through news, art, movies, books, music and more. Space is everywhere in our lives and therefore everyone can be involved in it. So keep up the pace. You can do this. Your reward awaits you, finding your pathway to space.Week 1 - We will start with Space in Journalism with Paul Daugherty where Paul and I will discuss the importance of communicating science and space matters in an engaging and accurate way. Space and Music, with Dr. Jay Keister, explores role music has had and continues to have in our perceptions of space. Both lessons are eye and ear opening.\n\nWeek 2 - This week includes two special discussions centered around art. To bring the wonder of space and the science we do to everyone is best done through art. In the Art of Space, Erin Espelie and I discuss the significance of art as effective tool to inspire those interested in space to pursue and/or question it further. Erin is filmmaker and created a film just for this course. Joby Harris and I discuss the significance of Visualizing Space Exploration in his lesson. Joby uses many tools to bring a space mission to life well before it has even been funded. He explains his process and demonstrates some of his creativity in a interesting demonstration.\n\nWeek 3 - In this time of history, movies and tv shows play a large role in the visual entertainment of humans and some animals. However before this medium, writings played that role. In this week's lesson we discuss both. With Scott Millspaugh's lesson on Space Through the Ages, we discuss how space and it's influence on society was captured and communicated over great periods of time. And how some of these beliefs lasted over a thousand years. In Space and Movies, Dr. Ernesto Acevedo Muñoz and I discuss the movie that changed everything when it comes to space as well as those before and after. \n\nWeek 4 - The last week of lessons. I purposely put them at the end as I feel they are a fitting way to end to this specialization. In Science Fiction, Dr. William Kuskin and I revisit the concept of Space and Wonder and its influence on our imagination. How the power of imagination generates hope for all that wield it. In One Pathway to Space, I walk you through a journey in rocket history and connect that history to one book that shaped humanity's future in space. And last but not least, we end the course and this specialization with one final goodbye to the crew and the USS Pathway to Space. In addition, I have arranged for a very special VIP transporter. It is truly the end but it is also just the beginning. Enjoy!"
