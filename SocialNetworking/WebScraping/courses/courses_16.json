Imagemaking is a fluid and exciting area of graphic design that comes out of practice and process: experimenting fearlessly, showing and sharing ideas, and giving and receiving knowledgeable and constructive input.For the sake of this online platform, we have applied some structure to our investigations, but for the most part imagemaking is loose and unstructured. If we must adopt a rule in this course it is only this: you will not become a graphic designer by watching videos alone. Or, don't just make stuff just in your head. So here, the focus here is on making, and you are expected to devote serious time and intellectual energy to that activity in this course. Specifically, you will:\n\n - experiment with a range of materials and techniques to make images for graphic design\n - expand your visual vocabulary both in terms of making and talking about work, in order to discuss your work and work of others\n - learn how to make, manipulate and arrange images to create compositions, eventually culminating in the design and production of an-image-based book.\n\nThe first half of the course is an opportunity to experiment and explore imagemaking in order to expand your visual vocabulary. You will create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or try out a media.\n\nIn the second two weeks, we’ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together by composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image’s connotations, meanings, and associations generated through elements of composition and “visual contrasts.” Ultimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.\n\nThe results of your assignments (and experiments) may generate something completely unknowable now or in the future—and that's the goal.",

Under normal circumstance, the immune response orchestrates a robust protection against these pathogens using both molecular and cellular mechanisms. This usually leads to direct or indirect inactivation of the infectious agent, so the disease symptoms may not appear. \n\nHowever, numerous pathogens have devised immune evasion strategies, which allow them to play ‘hide and seek’ with our immune system. The avoidance of human natural defences may result in host colonisation by a pathogen and thus an infection.

Simply put: by incorporating sustainability and social impact factors on people and planet into management decisions. Through this course, anyone can learn to improve their organization's practice of impact measurement and management and align their ESG or impact activities and reporting with emerging global standards.Impact Measurement and Management for the SDGs is a collaboration between UNDP SDG Impact and the award-winning team at CASE at Duke University.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a steward of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were launched in 2015 and to which 193 countries have signed up to achieve by 2030. The SDGs are a shared plan to end extreme poverty, reduce inequality, and protect the planet; they have become the world’s blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. \n\nBut the public sector cannot meet those goals alone. Climate change, poverty, racial and gender equity, food, health, education, clean water − the list of challenges faced by people and planet is too long. Businesses and investors have stepped in to help. The course was designed around the fundamental elements of the SDG Impact Standards, the only management standards that embed sustainability at the core of an organization in the holistic way intended by the creators of the SDGs. The course demonstrates how the SDG Impact Standards help organizations align with responsible business principles, other standards, and best practices in impact management. \n\nIn the course, you’ll learn to improve decision-making for positive impact on people and planet in line with the SDG Impact Standards and the Operating Principles for Impact Management. In the course, we have translated 4 universal practices of impact management into practical actions: SET STRATEGY, INTEGRATE, OPTIMIZE and REINFORCE. We teach the steps to implement these actions through short videos and lessons with concrete practical examples.\n\nProfessionals who know how to apply these sustainable management standards are increasingly in demand by institutions globally as they work to improve their performance and reporting around ESG and impact management. If you work or wish to work within an enterprise, a corporation, a fund that manages assets or an asset owner or advisory that oversees investment assets, or if you just want to learn more about impact investing, ESG, social finance or corporate reporting, this course will help you master the core concepts and practices in impact management for the SDGs and other impacts from enterprise and investor perspectives.\n\nThis course was written and is delivered by CASE Faculty Director Cathy Clark, and benefitted from extensive input from a larger team from UNDP, CASE, global academic advisors, and other experts.

    "content": "La OMS en el año 2011 publicó el Informe Mundial sobre la Discapacidad, en el cual se evidencia un aumento en la prevalencia de discapacidad de un 15% (anteriormente se estimaba entre un 7 y un 10% de la población). Las personas que viven en situación de discapacidad presentan mayores niveles de deprivación en diferentes ámbitos: inserción al mercado del trabajo, nivel educacional, etc.Esto nos obliga como sociedad a repensar nuestro trabajo en esta materia desde un enfoque que garantice igual trato para todos. Pues, una sociedad que espere promover igualdad de oportunidades y espacios de desarrollo para todos sus miembros, debe poner especial atención con aquellos sectores que han sido postergados durante generaciones, esto ocurre con especial fuerza en nuestros países del tercer mundo. No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acción hacía planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusión social para personas en situación de discapacidad.\n\n\nNosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada crítica de las prácticas de apoyo de las personas en situación de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 años del nacimiento de la Convención sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusión, comprensión y crítica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar prácticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ilegítimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonomía y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.\n\nEl propósito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad. De esta manera los los estudiantes podrán reflexionar sobre el enfoque de Derechos consagrado en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad, las diferencias conceptuales entre modelos, enfoques y teorías en el ámbito de la discapacidad en su proceso de tránsito conceptual.

    "content": "In the professional realm, most speeches and presentations we give are informative in scope. A scientist needs to explain her recent research findings. A financial officer needs to report on quarterly earnings to his company’s board. A technology professional needs to educate a consumer about a new product. Any time you need to convey ideas or demonstrate a process, you’re dealing with informative speaking.Informative speaking is a fun puzzle. You need to think from the perspective of your audience to identify what they need to hear in order to understand the key ideas. How much does the audience already know? What are the most important elements to convey? How should one convey these ideas with appropriate breadth and depth given the time constraints of the speech? This demands a strategic approach to speech design that we’ll undertake in this class.\n\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to explain complex ideas vividly and accessibly, design clear and compelling presentation slides, convey your passion for a topic while maintaining your professional credibility, and speak dynamically from notes and/or a manuscript. Learners will record speeches, providing and receiving peer feedback.",

This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n•\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.",

Design is becoming a capability-enhancing skill, equipping people with the ability to deal with uncertainty, complexity and failure.In this course, we demonstrate how you can use design as a way of thinking to provide strategic and innovative advantage within your profession. Suitable for anyone who is curious about design and translating the processes and tools of design thinking into innovative opportunities, over 5 weeks we explore, apply and practice the design process: think, make, break and repeat.\n\nThrough introducing theoretical concepts and examining industry case studies with leading Australian design firms, we investigate design as learning about the context (the thinking part), building prototypes as tangible representations (the making part) and testing potential solutions (the breaking part). We build on this by showing the productive value of moving through the process quickly and often (the repeating part), to improve ideas and develop new insights. \n\nThroughout the course, you will follow us through three of Australia’s most exciting design offices and learn from practicing designers and leaders in design. This insight into industry will enable you to develop a comprehensive understanding of design and the role it can and does play within the innovation landscape.

Las criptomonedas y el metaverso, que hasta entonces eran los focos de atención de periodistas, consultoras y curiosos, prácticamente han pasado al olvido.  A principios de 2024, solo se habla de Inteligencia Artificial es TODOS los ámbitos.  Para explicar este fenómeno, Yuval Noah Harari, autor de best-sellers internacionales como Homo Deus y Sapiens, dijo que la Inteligencia Artificial ha hackeado el sistema operativo de la humanidad, que es precisamente el lenguaje.  También dijo que, si no logramos establecer mecanismos de control correctos, podría precipitar el final de la historia humana.Sea como fuere, y sin caer en especulaciones acerca de su impacto, la Inteligencia Artificial se compone de distintas herramientas que, gracias a ChatGPT, han pasado de la oscuridad de laboratorios de científicos de datos al alcance de cualquier persona que tenga una PC hogareña o un smartphone.   De eso se trata este MOOC: introducir a curiosos al maravilloso mundo de la Inteligencia Artificial generativa, de la cual ChatGPT es el máximo exponente. \nVamos a entrar a este mundo de una manera amigable y simple, entender los principales conceptos que le dan forma, y aprender a sacarle jugo a ChatGPT para ayudarnos en tareas diarias, ya sea para fines laborales, estudiantiles o simplemente para curiosear y no perderse conocer lo último de lo último. \nComo ya dijimos, el secreto de la AI generativa ha sido utilizar el lenguaje como base de nuestras interacciones con los modelos (llamados LLMs).  Por esto, el curso se va a enfocar en brindar herramientas y ejemplos concretos para familiarizarnos con los “prompts” que son las órdenes que le damos a los modelos para que operen.

    "content": "This sequence of four courses will propose a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.The first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.\n\nThe third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as \"superstition\", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.\n\nThe courses are listed below:\n\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE)\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China II: Religious Transformation in the Period of Division (220-589 CE)\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China I: Religion and Thought in the Song, Jin, and Yuan (960-1368) \nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China II: Structuring Values (1850-2015)",

    "content": "This course is about caring for and educating children (and youth) with severe to profound intellectual disability. We use the idea of 'circles' to position the child at the center of the many levels of support needed. Around the child are circles of care and education - such as the parents, family, friends, caregivers, educators, health care workers, and others such as neighbors, business owners, and community members. Each one has an important role to play in the life of a person with an intellectual disability and can be seen as a caregiver and educator. Although this course is aimed particularly at caregivers who work at a  special centre or in a private home, each person in the circle of care and education plays a valuable role and will find the course useful.The course covers topics such as intellectual disability,  levels of severity of intellectual disability, and the history of intellectual disability. These inform how you can support children and youth with severe to profound intellectual disability so that they can reach their full potential and become participating members of society.  We look at lifelong learning by exploring brain development, the learning process, and how to maximise the opportunities for learning.\n\nWe ask experts about how best learning can be facilitated.  This includes looking at children’s learning support needs, how to go about planning activities for the learning programme, as well as how to empower multiple people who work in a team to care and educate children with severe to profound intellectual disability.\n\nIn the last week, we focus on rights, advocacy and relationships of care. Empowering and caring for caregivers themselves is a key focus of the course.\n\nFor professional development purposes, you can purchase a Verified Certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you can apply for Financial Aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee.",

For example, how quick should we be to accept something that someone else tells us is true, and what should we be looking out for when assessing a person's trustworthiness? Meanwhile, what should we do when we encounter disagreements with people who seem to be our equals? How and when should we adjust our beliefs, and how does the appropriate response vary depending on the evidence? These challenges may be especially important in the arena of religious disagreements. How should we weigh the evidence for and against various theistic and atheistic stances?Experts in psychology, philosophy, theology and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it’s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.\n\nIn this course. we will examine the following major questions about applied issues surrounding intellectual humility:\n \n•         Should you believe what people say?\n•         How should we handle disagreement?\n•         What is the role of evidence in resolving religious disagreements?\n \nAll lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life. \n\nThis course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility.

The Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across media.The course is designed as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre, multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human activity of storytelling.  Our journey will enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some key topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video games.  It will also take us to some landmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.\n\nDrawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists, composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of stories.

O curso é destinado a estudantes e profissionais de diferentes áreas além do ensino de idiomas (humanidades e ciências sociais, educação, clínica intercultural, estudos de arte e administração) que têm que enfrentar situações da vida cotidiana e relações com outros, onde ferramentas de reflexão são necessárias para ter uma abordagem intercultural.O(a) estudante deste MOOC desenvolverá a capacidade de refletir sobre sua historicidade (língua, plurilinguismo, filiações, visão cultural), suas identificações, sua identidade plural (idio-cultural e multicultural); da mesma forma, espera-se que o estudante seja mais reflexivo sobre si mesmo e seus discursos nas situações complexas que enfrenta.  Ele(a) prestará mais atenção a todas as formas de alteridade nos discursos, ações e tomadas de decisão que empreender; aprenderá a construir terceiros espaços e assumirá o papel de mediador em suas interações sociolinguísticas e experiências sociais.\n\nEste curso é destinado a profissionais de diversas áreas (com graduação ou pós-graduação, ou estudos técnicos pós-secundários), envolvidos principalmente no ensino de idiomas, mas não exclusivamente (ciências sociais, educação, administração). No final deste curso o aluno terá ferramentas que lhe permitirão refletir mais cuidadosamente sobre sua história, identidade, linguagem, discurso e reação a situações sociais que envolvam a compreensão intercultural dos demais.",
