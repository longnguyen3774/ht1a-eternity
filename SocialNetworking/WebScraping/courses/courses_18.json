It is recommended that participants in the MOOC Introduction to Linear Algebra have already taken, or take in parallel, the MOOC Introduction to Calculus.All of our modern technical and electronic systems, such as the internet and search engines, on which we rely and tend to take for granted in our daily lives, work because of methods and techniques adapted from classical linear algebra. The key ideas involve vector and matrix arithmetic as well as clever methods for working around or overcoming difficulties, a form of obstacle avoidance, articulated in this course as the Conjugation Principle.\n\nThis course emphasises geometric intuition, gradually introducing abstraction and algebraic and symbolic manipulation, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics. \n\nStudents taking Introduction to Linear Algebra will:\n\n•  gain familiarity with the arithmetic of geometric vectors, which may be thought of as directed line segments that can move about freely in space, and can be combined in different ways, using vector addition, scalar multiplication and two types of multiplication, the dot and cross product, related to projections and orthogonality (first week),\n•  develop fluency with lines and planes in space, represented by vector and Cartesian equations, and learn how to solve systems of equations, using the method of Gaussian elimination and introduction of parameters, using fields of real numbers and modular arithmetic with respect to a prime number (second week),\n•  be introduced to and gain familiarity with matrix arithmetic, matrix inverses, the role of elementary matrices and their relationships with matrix inversion and systems of equations, calculations and theory involving determinants (third week),\n•  be introduced to the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, how they are found or approximated, and their role in diagonalisation of matrices (fourth week),\n•  see applications to simple Markov processes and stochastic matrices, and an introduction to linear transformations, illustrated using dilation, rotation and reflection matrices (fourth week),\n•  see a brief introduction to the arithmetic of complex numbers and discussion of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (fourth week)."

    "content": "The course provides an introduction to quantum information at a beginning graduate level. It focuses on the fundamental understanding of how information is processed with quantum systems and how the quantum properties apply to computing and communication tasks. The course begins by presenting quantum theory as the framework of information processing. Quantum systems are introduced with single and two qubits. Axioms of quantum theory such as states, dynamics, and measurements are explained as preparation, evolution, and readout of qubits. Quantum computing and quantum communication are explained. Entanglement is identified as a key resource of quantum information processing. Manipulation and quantification of entangled states are provided.Quantum information processing opens an avenue to new information technologies beyond the current limitations but, more importantly, provides an approach to understanding information processing at the most fundamental level. What is desired is to find how Nature performs information processing with the quantum and classical systems. The ultimate power of Nature in computing and communication may be found and understood. The course provides a modest step to learn quantum information about how physical systems can be manipulated by the laws of quantum mechanics, how powerful they are in practical applications, and how the fundamental results make quantum advantages."

The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. \n\nCourse author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades.

Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This course will examine these questions and more."
