    "content": "Linear algebra and calculus are the two most important foundational pillars on which modern mathematics is built. They are studied by almost all mathematics students at university, though typically labelled as different subjects and taught in parallel. Over time, students discover that linear algebra and calculus are inseparable (but not identical) twins that interlock to form the backbone of almost all applications of mathematics to physical and biological sciences, engineering and computer science. It is recommended that participants in the MOOC Introduction to Linear Algebra have already taken, or take in parallel, the MOOC Introduction to Calculus.All of our modern technical and electronic systems, such as the internet and search engines, on which we rely and tend to take for granted in our daily lives, work because of methods and techniques adapted from classical linear algebra. The key ideas involve vector and matrix arithmetic as well as clever methods for working around or overcoming difficulties, a form of obstacle avoidance, articulated in this course as the Conjugation Principle.\n\nThis course emphasises geometric intuition, gradually introducing abstraction and algebraic and symbolic manipulation, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics. \n\nStudents taking Introduction to Linear Algebra will:\n\n•  gain familiarity with the arithmetic of geometric vectors, which may be thought of as directed line segments that can move about freely in space, and can be combined in different ways, using vector addition, scalar multiplication and two types of multiplication, the dot and cross product, related to projections and orthogonality (first week),\n•  develop fluency with lines and planes in space, represented by vector and Cartesian equations, and learn how to solve systems of equations, using the method of Gaussian elimination and introduction of parameters, using fields of real numbers and modular arithmetic with respect to a prime number (second week),\n•  be introduced to and gain familiarity with matrix arithmetic, matrix inverses, the role of elementary matrices and their relationships with matrix inversion and systems of equations, calculations and theory involving determinants (third week),\n•  be introduced to the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, how they are found or approximated, and their role in diagonalisation of matrices (fourth week),\n•  see applications to simple Markov processes and stochastic matrices, and an introduction to linear transformations, illustrated using dilation, rotation and reflection matrices (fourth week),\n•  see a brief introduction to the arithmetic of complex numbers and discussion of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (fourth week).",

Axioms of quantum theory such as states, dynamics, and measurements are explained as preparation, evolution, and readout of qubits. Quantum computing and quantum communication are explained. Entanglement is identified as a key resource of quantum information processing. Manipulation and quantification of entangled states are provided.Quantum information processing opens an avenue to new information technologies beyond the current limitations but, more importantly, provides an approach to understanding information processing at the most fundamental level. What is desired is to find how Nature performs information processing with the quantum and classical systems. The ultimate power of Nature in computing and communication may be found and understood. The course provides a modest step to learn quantum information about how physical systems can be manipulated by the laws of quantum mechanics, how powerful they are in practical applications, and how the fundamental results make quantum advantages.",

Also, almost everything is already connected to a Cloud, and much more will be in the future. Naturally, as this trend continues, in the near future almost all devices and appliances will include IoT modules which will use sensor data collection and control/management based on Clouds. Since we will live in an IoT world supported by Clouds, knowledge of the core technologies and platforms of IoT and Clouds will enable you with the tools to become a true leader in the future product and business world. In this course, the start-of-the-art IoT and wireless networks and Cloud technologies are introduced (for details on 1G to 5G mobile communications and smartphone and smart device technology, please take my course “Smart Device & Mobile Emerging Technologies”). This course ends with projects that teach how to analyze Bluetooth and W-Fi wireless networks and setup and use an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Virtual Computer in AWS (Amazon Web Service), which is the most powerful and popular Cloud technology in the world. Comparing to the human body, IoT is the neural network and the Cloud is the brain. Thus, I cordially welcome you into the brain and neural network of the future intelligence world!",

Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This course will examine these questions and more.",
