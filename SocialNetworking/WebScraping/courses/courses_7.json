Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?\n\nAWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.\n\nThis course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.",

After a short euphoria during which Central and Eastern Europe was incorporated into NATO and the European Union, and a slightly longer-lived American preponderance in the international system, developments of both a regional and global nature have emerged to challenge world peace and order. The course will start with a review of the driving forces of international Politics, followed by a description of the post-World War II international order, then move to its breakdown and will continue with the analysis of the events coming after the end of the Cold War culminating in the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe, the breakup of the Soviet Union and a short-lived uni-polar American domination of the international system. Attention will then be turned to various challenges and problem areas in contemporary World Politics including disorders in the Balkans resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the rise of China and the return of Russia as a major actor in the world stage, the humanitarian disasters in Bosnia and Kosovo where the West intervened; and Rwanda, Kenya etc. where it did not. Continuing with an analysis of the Arab Spring where democratic aspirations mainly failed and the resulting dislocations fanned the expansion of radical Islam and the associated wave of global terrorism. Next the course will examine frozen conflicts such as the Arab-Israeli and Myanmar (Rohingya) conflicts and conclude by looking at the problems of the global commons such as climate change, pollution, pandemics and the growing problem of refugees.

En este curso se estudian empíricamente algunos aspectos relevantes de esas variedades de la lengua con datos significativos de las versiones hispanas de J. D. Salinger: «El cazador oculto», argentinas; y «El guardián entre el centeno», españolas.\nLas Encuestas de Evaluación de la edición anterior (http://bit.ly/1QYPAJI) permiten hacerse una idea cabal de las consideraciones que ha merecido el curso.\n\nEn este curso, con una consideración policéntrica de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección de los textos propios y ajenos; por las diferencias de estilo en dos versiones de G. V. Higgins; y por las variedades peninsular y argentina o americana de la lengua española en las diferentes versiones de J.D. Salinger.\n\nLa finalidad del curso es doble. \nAnte un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre lo que se dice; y sobre cómo se diría mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión, con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente. \nY, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor lo que se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión; con gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración. \n\nFinalizar este curso le permitirá: \n1. Primero, identificar, advertir y argumentar las posibles inconvenientes (sin prestigio) de expresión en textos de autores españoles. \n2. Segundo, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones (¿de estilo?) entre dos versiones españolas actuales de «Los amigos de Eddie Coyle», de G. V. Higgins (1973 [El Chivato] frete a la versión de 2011), \n3. Tercero, estudiar y evaluar empíricamente algunos aspectos significativos de las alternativas y variaciones del español en España y en Argentina con datos de las cuatro versiones en español de J. D. Salinger («El guardián entre el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto», versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). \n\nEstos dos últimos objetivos tiene más valor por dos motivos: \n•\tLos textos de observación cumplen, sin duda, una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos de Higgins) o alternativa (con variaciones de lengua, argentina y americana, o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir lo dicho en el texto fuente.\n•\tLas versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’, desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua. \n\nNo es un curso sobre datos. Es un curso que, con algunos datos, opera sobre la competencia en advertir inconvenientes o aciertos expresivos y sobre la valoración y argumentación de diferentes alternativas de expresión y de algunas manifestaciones de la variedad argentina y española de lengua.",

    "content": "This course deals directly with your ability for creativity which is a critical skill in any field. It focuses on divergent thinking, the ability to develop multiple ideas and concepts to solve problems. Through a series of creativity building exercises, short lectures, and readings, learners develop both an understanding of creativity and increase their own ability.This course will help you understand the role of creativity and innovation in your own work and in other disciplines.  It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration.  This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. \n\nThe principal learning activity in the course is a series of \"differents\" where you are challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Beginning with a prompt, e.g. \"eat something different\", you will begin to recognize your own = limits and to overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by it's nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society. In this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. At the same time, these exercises are constrained by concerns of safety, legality, and economics, which are addressed in their creative process.",

Building upon that foundation, the class then covers the sample preparation issues, data collection strategies, and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic modalities of modern cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D crystallography.Philosophy:\nThe course emphasizes concepts rather than mathematical details, taught through numerous drawings and example images.  It is meant for anyone interested in the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D EM, including cell biologists or molecular biologists without extensive training in mathematics or imaging physics and practicing electron microscopists who want to broaden their understanding of the field.  The class is perfect as a primer for anyone who is about to be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist, or for anyone who needs an introduction to the field to be able to understand the literature or the talks and conversations they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.\n\nPre-requisites:\nThe recommended prerequisites are college-freshman-level math, physics, and biochemistry.\n\nPace: \nThere are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual “modules” lasting on average 20 minutes each.  Each module has at the end a list of “concept check” questions you can use to test your knowledge of what was presented. As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects, one reasonable plan would be to go through one major subject each day.  That would mean watching a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or so thinking through the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another reasonable plan would be to go through one module each day for a little over a month, or even three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a 3-month term.\n\nIt is likely that as you then move on to actually begin using a cryo-EM or otherwise engage in the field, you will want to repeat certain modules.",

Too often though our perceptions about Aboriginal peoples consign them to an ancient past or perpetuates stereotypical imaginations that Aboriginal peoples live in remote communities (Hinkson, 2010).  \n\nAt the heart of this MOOC is the theme that Sovereignty was never ceded and Sydney always was and always will be Aboriginal Land. Despite this the Aboriginal presence in the city is often invisible to non-Aboriginal eyes. This course aims to bring to light marginalised narratives of Aboriginal presence in this space.\n\nTo understand hidden and marginalised narratives and experiences it is necessary to develop cultural competence capabilities. Key elements of practicing cultural competence include being able to understand and interrogate context, which in the case of Sydney includes not only learning about the peoples, places and histories of Aboriginal Sydney but to also understand issues about how knowledge is created and how dominant narratives can exclude diverse knowledges and experiences. \n\nCourse learning outcomes\n\n1.\tDevelop knowledge about cultural competence capabilities. \n2.\tDevelop a deeper and multi-layered knowledge and understanding about Aboriginal peoples, cultures and places in Sydney.\n3.\tDevelop a greater understanding of how history, cultures and places are represented, contested and interpreted and how that relates to their own context. \n\nAcknowledgement of Country\n\nWe acknowledge that this course was developed on the land of the Gadigal Peoples of the Eora nation. We pay our respect to the Traditional Owners of this land and acknowledge that the land that the University of Sydney was built on has been a place of learning for many thousands of years.",

Gentrification is a term which has been used to describe the process by which wealthier people move into an area leading to the displacement of poorer groups who are priced out of the area by increases in rents and housing prices.  It is usually associated with physical improvements to the housing stock and to changes in local shops and services.   Sometimes it is closely associated with the displacement of black people by white people.  Gentrification is never neutral in its effects.  Places change.  They look and feel different and different people live there.There are winners and losers, incomers and those displaced, all of whom are caught up in a process by which the social status of an area can often change beyond recognition.   Gentrification is both a social and a spatial process.  It is not surprising therefore to find that most people who have written about gentrification are either sociologists or geographers.  \n\nIn this course we will learn how the term gentrification originated and the way in which the term has developed since its first sighting in the 1960s.  We will consider different theoretical explanations for processes of change and ask questions about who wins and loses.  After acquiring theoretical and conceptual skills we will apply these to a series of international case studies to understand what gentrification might look like and feel like in different places.  What changes?  How do you measure change?  What happens to the people displaced- where do they go to?  Who are the newcomers?  This course will give you insights which will help you better understand neighbourhood level changes; inspire you to learn more about the interaction of social and spatial changes and to think critically about the future of neighbourhoods with which you are familiar.",

    "name": "Cutting-edge Technology in Air Conditioning System",
    "content": "In the dynamic field of HVAC technology, strategies like Demand Control Ventilation (DCV) are revolutionizing indoor air quality and energy efficiency. DCV dynamically adjusts ventilation rates based on real-time occupancy and air quality indicators, optimizing conditions for occupants while minimizing energy consumption. Adherence to codes and standards, notably ASHRAE Standard 62.1, ensures the safety and efficiency of DCV systems.A key focus of DCV is monitoring and controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, a crucial indicator of indoor air quality. Elevated CO2 levels prompt real-time adjustments in ventilation rates, preventing the accumulation of pollutants and promoting a constant supply of fresh air. This adaptive approach aligns with principles promoting occupant health and well-being.\n\nDesigning ventilation rates within DCV involves considering factors such as occupancy, space size, and specific application requirements. Strategies like damper control and precise positioning efficiently meet ventilation demands. DCV's versatility extends to both Constant Air Volume (CAV) and Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems.\n\nIn Constant Air Volume (CAV) systems, DCV optimizes airflow by modulating it based on real-time occupancy and air quality data. This ensures ventilation precisely tailored to the immediate needs of the space, balancing energy efficiency and air quality maintenance. In Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems, DCV adjusts the air supply to match demand, optimizing energy conservation without compromising air quality. An example illustrates the seamless integration of DCV within a VAV system, showcasing practical impact.\n\nCO2 sensors, including advanced types like nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors, play a pivotal role in DCV systems. Proper sensor placement ensures accurate readings, enhancing overall effectiveness by providing precise data on indoor air quality.\n\nShifting to the broader context of HVAC, understanding fans, their history, and diverse applications is essential. Fans, integral to industrial processes and electronics cooling, have evolved with various types, including centrifugal and axial fans. Appreciating fan terminologies like pressure, flow rate, speed, and efficiency becomes vital.\n\nCentrifugal fans excel in scenarios requiring directed and pressurized airflow, while axial fans are ideal for linear airflow applications. Grasping fan terminologies is crucial for optimizing performance. The affinity laws and fan control strategies govern efficiency, providing insights into operational optimization. Fan performance curves visually depict relationships between airflow, pressure, and power consumption, aiding in selecting and optimizing fan systems.\n\nExpanding the horizon, Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems mark a milestone in HVAC technology. Evolving from traditional systems, VRF systems offer a dynamic and energy-efficient approach. Continuous advancements introduce features like individual zone control, energy efficiency, and adaptability to variable loads.\n\nThe escalating demand for energy-efficient HVAC solutions underscores the need for VRF systems. Their capacity for simultaneous heating and cooling, coupled with precise temperature control, makes them preferred in various applications. Designing VRF systems involves meticulous consideration of factors like building size, occupancy, and specific requirements for each zone. The connectivity or combination ratio, indicating the number of indoor units connected to a single outdoor unit, significantly influences system efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, from Demand Control Ventilation to advanced fan systems and Variable Refrigerant Flow, these strategies form a comprehensive picture of HVAC technology. Rooted in energy efficiency and sustainability, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future of indoor environmental control, catering to occupant comfort, operational efficiency, and environmental responsibility.\n\n\nTarget Learners:\n1.\tKnowledge of Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer \n2.\tUndergraduate students of Mechanical who are in either Vth, VIth, VIIth or VIIIth semester\n3.\tGraduate students of Mechanical\n4.\tWorking professionals with B.Tech./B.E., in Mechanical \n5.\tDiploma students of  Mechanical",
