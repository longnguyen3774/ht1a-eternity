The steps and materials needed to complete your college application \n\nThis course is designed for students who are planning to apply to college soon (11th graders and 12th graders), but the activities and videos can still be useful for students who are earlier in their college search journey as they plan for the future. Regardless of where you are in your understanding of the college search process—from those who are the first in their family to pursue a bachelor’s degree and who may be trying to figure out where to even begin—to those who are well on their way to preparing an application—this course provides a road map to helping you move through this journey in your own way and on your own time.    \n\nThis course is open to the public, asynchronous, and self-directed without a facilitator. Please note although this course is designed by the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), this is not a course about applying to Penn.  \n\nThe course is also intended for students who may not have access to college counseling – if you attend a school that offers college counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to college.  \n\nThis course is for students who are applying to college for the first time, intending to pursue undergraduate degrees at a four-year institution in the U.S. \n\nIf you are an international student attending a school outside the U.S. interested in learning more about navigating the U.S. university system and application process, we recommend enrolling in this course: Applying to US Universities."

En el segundo módulo, se presenta la fragmentación como una técnica muy sencilla, que trata de fragmentar ideas y conceptos, a modo de poder retenerlos y utilizar el pensamiento de manera más eficaz. En el tercer módulo, se aborda los problemas de procrastinación, ese gran reto que hace difícil reconciliar nuestra vida diaria con el aprendizaje. Por último, en el cuarto módulo, se expone cómo liberar todo tu potencial y utilizar el aprendizaje realmente para todo aquello que el participante se plantee: aquí se busca convencer a la persona, la edad o el envejecimiento no son limitantes, tampoco se necesita envidiar a los genios; pues una vez que se aprende, se descubrirá todo lo que realmente una persona es capaz de aprender."

    "content": "‘The Arbitration of International Disputes’ is the third course of Leiden University’s  series on International Law in Action. The first course covered generalities on the international courts and tribunals in The Hague, while the second course provided an insider's  perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  This third course explores the major aspects of international arbitration as one of the most common method of international dispute settlement . Through this course you will gain an in-depth understanding of the  various facets of international arbitration through the analysis of its role as a mechanism of dispute settlement, its institutions, the fields of law it is applicable to, and, of course, its most famous awards.The main question we will answer together during this course is \"Can international arbitration contribute to the creation of a peaceful world through the settlement of disputes between States and between States and non-State actors?\" In order to do so, we will learn the basic historical concepts or arbitration, as well as everything there is to know about the Permanent Court of Arbitration, based in The Hague. We will then dive into the role of international arbitration in settling disputes relating to the Law of the Sea, with a particular insight into the landmark South China Sea Arbitration. For an entire module, we will focus on investment arbitration, its principles and the procedure of the ICSID, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. We will conclude the course with a module on the interplay between state immunity and enforcement of arbitral awards. This is brought to light through the Yukos Arbitration which is a perfect illustration of the topic.\n\nThis course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into international arbitration, its role and the current issues relating to it. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the principles and rules of arbitration. You will explore the topic through concrete examples and the most prominent arbitrations. You will also grasp the notion of international arbitration navigating between law and politics. International arbitration and The Hague go hand in hand: several key arbitration institutes are located in The Hague and important disputes were settled here through arbitration. The Hague is, so to speak, ‘the place to be for international arbitration’, especially when we are dealing with arbitration between States, or arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and States. \n\nJoin us for the course and become an expert on international arbitration!\n\nThis course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option. If you want a certificate, but are unable to pay for it, you can request financial aid via Coursera."

What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground. A privileged point of view of our course is the ancient Phoenician city of Motya, located exactly at the centre of the “sea in the middle”. Throughout the live experience of excavation, with images taken on the field, this course will let you touch the many tesserae of the great mosaic of the Mediterranean Civilization.

This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors."

Además, desentrañaremos los misterios de este importante período histórico y descubriremos cómo su legado perdura hasta nuestros días.Comenzaremos explorando cómo el cristianismo construyó el pensamiento medieval y dio forma al arte simbólico que aún resuena en nuestra sociedad actual. En la siguiente etapa de nuestro viaje, nos adentraremos en la Temprana Edad Media, explorando el arte paleocristiano y las influencias de los pueblos bárbaros en la cultura europea. Desde las pinturas en las catacumbas hasta los relieves de los sarcófagos, cada obra de arte nos cuenta una historia única sobre la convergencia de culturas y la evolución del arte en un período de transformación. Mientras tanto en Oriente, recorreremos el momento de oro del Imperio Bizantino con la imponente Santa Sofía. \nPero nuestro viaje no se detiene ahí. Avanzaremos hacia la Alta Edad Media, donde el arte del Imperio Carolingio nos develará que hubo renacimientos antes del Renacimiento. Veremos también el surgimiento del Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico con un arte que se presenta como un antecedente del Románico, un estilo internacional que nos cautivará con su enfoque en la peregrinación y el mundo monástico. Examinaremos la iconografía del Juicio Final y nos sumergiremos en el fascinante mundo de los manuscritos iluminados.\nFinalmente, indagaremos en el arte de la Baja Edad Media y la llegada del arte gótico, explorando las majestuosas catedrales y los vitrales que aún hoy nos maravillan con su belleza y esplendor. A medida que exploramos las diferencias entre el arte románico y gótico, también reflexionaremos sobre cómo estas formas de expresión artística reflejan las preocupaciones y aspiraciones de una sociedad en evolución.\nEste curso no solo es un viaje a través del tiempo, sino también una exploración de la belleza, la creatividad y la inspiración que el arte medieval tiene para ofrecer. El objetivo es que, al finalizar el recorrido, puedas tener una conciencia clara de las complejas relaciones entre el arte medieval y la sociedad de la época. Además, serás capaz de comprender y construir significados a partir de la iconografía, aspectos estilísticos y culturales de las obras de arte medieval."

That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.\n\t\nThis course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. \n\nLearning Objectives\nThere are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with a quiz and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums: www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano: \nwww.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano): eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia): www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust: www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum: www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org/en/list/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence): www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino: www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles."

Digital technologies frequently make a lot of promises. However, in recent years, we have seen an increasing number of artists address fundamental issues of the Digital Transformation, such as surveillance, lack of representation, and digital illiteracy. Artists have demonstrated that, while digital technologies have the potential to support processes leading to greater equality, they are frequently viewed as perpetuating and even exacerbating inequalities.This course is primarily aimed at changemakers who want to build a better digital future with the help of the arts.\n\nThis course will teach you how the arts can influence technology development through art and enterprise collaborations; how the arts can assist citizens and civil society in making sense of and overcoming the challenges brought on by the Digital Transformation; and how the arts can influence the processes of regulation, policy-making, and legislation within the Digital Transformation. The course also provides insights into arts organisation, reflecting on issues of funding and community building that many engaged artists face. Building on theoretical concepts, questions about the arts and technology will be elaborated and explored through conversations with brilliant artists, makers, curators, and others working at the intersection of the arts and technology, who will generously share their knowledge and experiences with us.\n\nIf you are an artist or an organisation interested in learning more about the power of the arts to influence digital transformation, this is the place to start. This course will provide you with the foundation and inspiration to begin or continue work on investigating, promoting, and facilitating more equal, inclusive, and democratic digital futures. It will provide you with an understanding of the challenges and opportunities of the Digital Transformation, as well as concrete ideas for how the arts can help."

    "content": "For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nRelated Resources\n--------------------------------\n\nOnline resources are available here:\nhttps://newlearningonline.com\n\n--------------------------------\nJoin our Online Communities!\n--------------------------------\n\nCGScholar (Create an account and join the New Learning community)\nhttps://cgscholar.com/community/community_profiles/new-learning/community_updates\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/newlearningonline\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/neolearning\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the Assessment for Learning course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions.

But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe.\n\nEach week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result. We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with some basic physics, how we interpret the data to make scientific discoveries.\n\nThe class will consist of video lectures, weekly quizzes, and discussion forums. Each week there will be five videos, totalling approximately 40 minutes. They will be in a regular pattern - a short introduction, an example science story, an explanation of the key technology area, a look at how the technology is used in practice, and finally a look at what the future may hold."

Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization."

Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students interested in tackling all facets of optimization applications. You will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest. This will allow you to unlock the power of industrial solving technologies, which have been perfected over decades by hundreds of PhD researchers.  With access to this advanced technology, problems that are considered inconceivable to solve before will suddenly become easy.\n\nWatch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc3cBvtrem0&t=8s"

    "content": "The coordination of life in multicellular organisms is precisely controlled by cells via various internal and external signals. Cells depend on different types of signals to regulate their growth, division, metabolism as well as death. Signals are growth factors or hormones produced and secreted by other cells. Some signals such as nutrients are in the form of molecules from the environment. Signaling molecules are sensed by direct binding to specific receptor molecules. Depending on the biochemical properties and ways of molecules changes, we can group various signaling events in defined pathways. Throughout specific signal transduction pathways, a signal can modulate cellular activities and gene expression, thereby leading to changes in cell growth, metabolism, differentiation, or many other cellular functions. When genetic mutations or biochemical changes occur in key proteins of certain cellular signaling pathways, cellular homeostasis can be disrupted, thus triggering tissue malfunctions, itiation or spread of cancer, or developmental anomalies. Dissecting biochemical principles of these cell signaling pathways is essential for us to better understand mechanisms of both normal cells and pathological conditions, therefore our knowledge on signal transduction will provide valuable information to develop effective therapeutic agents to fight against diseases..This 6 week-course will give you a solid introduction to the basic fundamentals of cell signaling. I will first define the concept of cell signaling and introduces major types of cellular signaling events. Throughout 6 weeks, we will study biochemical basis of electrical signaling, chemical signaling as well as gap junction-mediated signaling pathways. We will also learn about key principles underlying signal transduction pathways by studying significance of protein-protein interactions and signaling second messengers. In the end of each week, dysregulated cell signaling in pathological conditions such as cancer and diabetes will be presented and discussed. Everyone knows that cell signaling is essential for sustaining life. How can you explain insulin actions in lowering glucose in biochemical details? What can be the fundamental mode of oxygen sensing in our body? Have you ever thought about ways of how we can specifically remove or kill certain types of rapidly-growing cancer cells? Cell signaling accompanies various biochemical strategies to sense and transmit signals inside our cells. Without fine control of those signaling processes, cells, tissues, and organisms cannot maintain life."

    "content": "More than one century after the Wright brothers' first flight, the flight still defy our intuition. You will learn here how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry. For that, we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplane's movement and attitude in space, and a refresher on basic general mechanic principles. You will remind how Newton's 2nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple - or on an airplane, to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed. Coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy, you will discover the very useful concept of total height and you will be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude, while changes in total height are much slower.In the end, you will discover that only a very small number of forces apply on an airplane in flight and that you will be able to classify those that change its energy state and those that modify its trajectory. You will discover the concept of load factor and understand why the pilot of a combat aircraft can feel a weight nine-time greater than his actual weight! Finally, we will establish the lift and propulsion equations, that form the basis of flight mechanics, and you will be able to compute the lift and thrust necessary to follow a given trajectory at a given speed.\n\nThis course is for anybody interested in learning more about how planes work, the physics of flying, or flight mechanics. It will be of particular interest to undergraduate students in aerospace engineering, trainees as well as senior pilots, journalists, and professionals in the aeronautics sector.\n\nAlthough some mathematical formalism may be present sometimes. It is always doubled by sketches, figures, and hands-explanations. So that, anybody can skip the formulas without losing the core understanding of the concepts.\n\nNo apples were harmed in the making of this course...\n\nThis course is only a foretaste of the mechanics of flight. ISAE-SUPAERO and Eric Poquillon will offer you other courses and the first specialization in autumn 2021. Initially, three courses will be published to answer several questions: Can we fly as high as we want? What is a stall? Why do some planes have propellers and others have jet engines? Is an airplane always stable? How do you control an airplane following an engine failure? All this and more will be covered in this series of flight mechanics courses.\n\nThis course is a part of the specialization \"Fundamentals of Flight mechanics\"."
