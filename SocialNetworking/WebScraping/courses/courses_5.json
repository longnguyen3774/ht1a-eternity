This course is designed to help an investor, businessperson or economist approach macroeconomic, institutional and international data and derive information from the indicators that point to the types of opportunities and risks that they present.  Students will gain practice by handling the data of some of the largest economies in the world –the United States, Japan, the European Union, China and India—and “reading the story” of their economies from their data, yielding surprisingly profound conclusions about their present and future. The course is the third in a series for the specialization but it is also a stand-alone course for anyone who wants practice in practical macroeconomics.This course includes 4 modules, each one deep-diving into the macroeconomic circumstances that have been brought up in the recent history of four key regions: the USA, Japan, Europe, and China and India.  Students will analyze the ways in which international economies relate with one another, the benefits of trade and migration and economic development and how it occurs, among other themes.  \n\nProfessor Allard takes overarching macroeconomic theory and turns it into a practical tool for those interested in the opportunities and risks of investment and doing business in each of the four regions covered."

Course 3 has nine lessons spread out over 4 weeks with 31 Learning Objectives. In this course, we will discover who and what funds the exploration that we have enjoyed learning about in Course 1 and 2. We will also focus on a few specific applications of some of the concepts we have learned about so far with two companies, the Global Positioning System, and the an academic program that could be implemented at your institution of higher learning.Week 1 - There are three lessons this week that will cover a range of topics that greatly influence where space exploration has been, is today, and will go. The Politics of Space, with Jack Waldorf and Abby Benson will provide a basic overview of how space missions are funded in the US government. Space Governance with Dr. Zach Donohew and Eric Alston, JD will present the case and justification for how we as species will need to govern what we do in space. The Business of Space with Dr. Dan Baker, will cover the basics of the space industry from the size to the value of doing business in space. These topics will build on many of the others we have covered in the other courses and in the lessons ahead.\n\nWeek 2 - This week's topic is Space Entrepreneurship and it is broken it into two parts. Both parts involve real-world space entrepreneurs. Part 1 is with Dr. James Stuart who has started many space companies and continues to work with other entrepreneurs as they push the boundary of what we do in space. Part 2 is with Scott Tibbitts, who has a very unique background and path to being a space entrepreneur but that did not stop him and his company from enabling NASA to explore Mars. These lessons will give you a new perspective on the impact entrepreneurs have in space exploration.\n\nWeek 3 and Week 4 are application lessons where we take a deep dive into a few of the many examples where space is used in our daily lives and how companies and academic programs are helping to bring access to space to everyone. The Global Positioning System (GPS), with Dr. Penny Axelrad, is so ingrained in our daily lives that we may not even realize we are using it. We will discuss how it came to be and how it will be used for years to come. David Ferguson and I will discuss SpaceX's Starship and Starlink programs and how one company is changing our vision for how we explore and use space. The Access to Space for All with Sierra Space, with Dr. Janet Kavandi, covers how one company, that many may not have heard of, has big plans for science and tourism in space. Dr. Kavandi also has some interesting space experience! The last lesson of this course covers an academic program at the University of Colorado Boulder call the Space Minor. Ashleigh Bailey and I discuss this unique program that allows students of all majors to minor in space. This program is a model of other institutions of higher education around the world. \n\nSo please consider enrolling and then let's hit the trail."

A l’estudiar problemes bàsics de les Ciències apareixen funcions de diverses variables. Per exemple, la temperatura d’un punt de l’aire depèn de la posició (tres coordenades reals) i del temps (una quarta variable real). La velocitat d’un mòbil a l’espai és un vector amb tres coordenades que depèn de la posició i del temps. Si ja heu seguit un curs de càlcul diferencial en una variable el nostre curs us pot servir per a començar a entendre les dificultats inherents al món de les diverses variables. Si esteu seguint ja un curs presencial sobre el tema el nostre curs us pot servir com a reforç i com a complement.Al final del curs entendreu la noció de funció diferenciable, de derivada parcial, de gradient, sabreu com es troben els extrems (màxim i mínim) locals d’una funció de diverses variables, tant en el cas lliure com en el condicionat. En el cas d’extrems condicionats sabreu el paper que juga la condició de Lagrange i com s’utilitza. Sabreu en quins casos es pot trobar una funció implícita a partir d’una equació al pla o a l’espai.\nPel camí haureu tingut un primer contacte amb la topologia de l’espai euclidià n-dimensional, la noció de límit i de compacitat."

El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo, la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo (TFC) para establecer la relación entre ambos conceptos. En el presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio.Vamos a iniciar con la interpretación del Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo, con esto nos referimos a descubrir su significado real en la solución de problemas. Llegaremos a asociar con él la actividad práctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretación, los conceptos de derivada e integral se verán relacionados desde un principio, lo que te permitirá predecir el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Las nociones fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de “razón de cambio” y de “acumulación del cambio”, y el TFC nos proveerá de la estrategia de solución.\n \nRecordarás que la Matemática Elemental incluye el Álgebra, la Geometría y la Geometría Analítica. Podemos decir que éstas son Matemáticas que estudian lo estático. En cambio, la Matemática Superior, que incluye el Cálculo, estudia lo dinámico. Con el Cálculo se inicia el estudio del cambio, una realidad presente en nuestro entorno cotidiano sin duda alguna. Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energías, capitales de inversión, longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrás entender al Cálculo como una estrategia de solución para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo de las Matemáticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante información.\n \nAl finalizar este curso podrás:\n\nDescribir de qué manera los modelos matemáticos polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonométricos (seno y coseno), son una construcción que responde a esta práctica de predicción. Los verás a todos ellos surgir de esta práctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas condiciones en su “razón de cambio” con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende. \n\nUtilizar la introducción de procesos infinitos (¡no imposibles!) en la construcción de la respuesta de predicción, con ello entenderás por qué se habla de Matemática Superior y de un pensamiento matemático avanzado.\n\nValorar una forma de pensar diferente, donde nuestro razonamiento matemático trascienda la sola manipulación de fórmulas algebraicas."

La démarche proposée se veut critique, il ne s’agit ni de canoniser ni de condamner Calvin, mais de comprendre sa pensée avec toute la distance requise et d’en analyser les enjeux.\n\nAu cours de la première semaine, nous explorerons les principales étapes de la vie de Calvin. Les semaines 2 et 3 seront consacrées à l’étude de sa pensée théologique et de son éthique. Enfin, lors des semaines 4 et 5, nous nous interrogerons sur la diffusion du calvinisme dans le monde et la pertinence actuelle de la pensée de Calvin.\n\n--\nThis course is an introduction to the life and thought of the reformer John Calvin (1509-1564) and to his influence on the modern and contemporary world. The approach we develop is critical:  we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.\n\nDuring five weeks, we will explore together the life and work of the Reformer. During the first week, we will study the main aspects of Calvin’s life. Weeks 2 and 3 will focus on his theology and his ethics. During the last two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), we will ponder how Calvinism became a worldwide phenomenon and ask ourselves what kind of relevance Calvin’s thought may still have today."

    "content": "The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance.Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\n\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \n\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\n\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210."

We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society? This MOOC explores different scientifically validated methods that can help you to better understand your pet, to enrich their lives and help you to be a more educated and confident pet owner.\n\nLearners can apply for Financial Aid directly with Coursera to assist with the cost of accessing the full course and gaining a certificate for successfully completing the course."

Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course – given by specialists in the field – goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.  It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes célèbres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice. Some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.******************\nSpecial thanks to our translators, in particular the University of Lausanne and the School of Criminal Justice sincerely thank Massimiliano Stabile (forensic biologist), Francesco Zampa (forensic chemist) and Giampietro Lago (forensic biologist) for the Italian translation of the course."

This surge of interest has been fuelled by chemical biology’s applicability to understanding critical processes in live cells or model organisms in real time. This success has arisen because chemical biology straddles a nexus between chemistry, biology, and physics. Thus, chemical biology can harness rapid chemistry to observe or perturb biological processes, that are in turn reported using physical assays, all in an otherwise unperturbed living entity.Although its boundaries are endless, the multidisciplinary nature of chemical biology can make the field seem daunting; we beg to differ! Here, we deconstruct chemical biology into its core components, and repackage the material. In the process we build up for each student a practical and theoretical knowledge bank that will set these students on their way to understanding and designing their own chemical biology experiments. \n\nWe will discuss fluorescence as a general language used to read out biological phenomena as diverse as protein localization, membrane tension, surface phenomena, and enzyme activity. We will proceed to discuss protein labeling strategies and fusion protein design. Then we will discuss larger and larger scale chemical biology mechanism and screening efforts. Highlights include a large amount of new data, tailored in the lab videos, and a large number of skilled presenters."

You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.In order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.\n\nTo illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University. These scientists will give a look in their field of knowledge and their collaboration with colleagues, to illustrate how the theory you will learn translates to practice.\n\nIn sum, we invite you to follow us on a journey to understand child development from synapse to society!"

Guided by three course instructors who have lived and worked with the Gombe chimpanzees, you will learn how Goodall’s early discoveries changed our view of human uniqueness. By completing the course, you will gain a new appreciation of the deep similarities between chimpanzees and humans in intelligence, tool use, hunting, personality and social relationships, as well as some key differences. You will learn how chimpanzees interact with their environment and how their behavior is influenced by ecology, as well as the severe conservation challenges they face today. And you will employ your new knowledge of chimpanzees to construct a persuasive argument for their protection. This course is open to everyone interested in learning more about these fascinating and complex beings. Knowledge of high-school level biology is beneficial but not required. Please keep in mind, however, that the content of this course will cover all aspects of chimpanzee life, including scientific discussion of sexual and aggressive behaviors."

    "content": "One of the most significant changes in the world in the past 30 years is the opening of China to the outside world and its engagement with that world. In the initial years of the opening, external forces influenced China’s economy, regional balances, bureaucracy, as well as the political authority of local leaders in the coastal areas. More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected China’s internal development. We then look at various aspects of China’s “going out strategy” — its search for energy, talent, as well as its relations with the United States and the states within the Asia-Pacific region. The instructor has been deeply engaged in research on all these topics, having lived in China during various stages of China’s opening to the outside world.Course Overview video: https://youtu.be/7FpNL67EbE4"

It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a “political” economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese Politics Part 2 – China and the World.Course Overview video: https://youtu.be/7FpNL67EbE4"

He examines the meaning and significance of four key virtues—kindness, hope, humility, and generosity—and their importance to living a good life. \n\nFurther, you will consider the practical aspects of living a virtuous life. We will discuss the challenges to living the virtues, and examine how they can be cultivated by incorporating contemplative practices in your everyday life. \n\nWeek 1 draws on baptism as our initiation into a new story and way of being in the world. In Week 1, you will explore the virtue of kindness through the character of God, reflected in how we treat ourselves and others. Week 2 focuses on hope. In Week 3, you will explore the virtue of humility, and reflecting on the paradox that trying to be humble often ends in pride. Finally, Week 4 closes with an exploration of generosity, demonstrating how different virtues reveal the God who is unrelentingly generous."

Este curso busca facilitar la comprensión de cómo es ese proceso y, para ello, se enfoca exclusivamente en el subsector de la energía eléctrica.Para desarrollar un proyecto de ciencia de datos energéticos se necesita que confluyan dos tipos de conocimiento: por una parte, un conocimiento sobre el sector eléctrico (cómo es su estructura, cuáles son sus principales retos, cómo funciona) y , por otra, un conocimiento sobre la ciencia de datos (cuáles son sus fundamentos, cómo opera, qué tipo de aportes puede dar). Por esa razón, es usual que se constituyan equipos interdisciplinarios en los que confluyen tanto expertos en energía como expertos en análisis de datos. \n\nNo es fácil para estos expertos poder dialogar, porque el conocimiento especializado suele tener también un lenguaje especializado y no es fácil compartir la experticia con personas que no son especialistas en nuestro campo de conocimiento. \n\nJustamente, este curso busca ayudar a facilitar ese diálogo y a sobrepasar esas barreras de comunicación. \n\nPara ello, lo que haremos será presentar los elementos básicos, fundamentales de cada una de las dos áreas del conocimiento con una perspectiva más amplia que profunda. El propósito es el de adquirir una comprensión de alto nivel de tanto los elementos del sector eléctrico como de la ciencia de datos. Aspiramos que, al finalizar exitosamente este curso, usted pueda entender y explicar cómo funciona el proceso de ciencia de datos aplicado a los problemas del sector eléctrico.\n\n¿Cómo está estructurado el curso? El curso tiene seis módulos y en cada uno de esos módulos trabajamos un tema del área de energía y un tema del área de ciencia de datos, que confluyen en una aplicación concreta o, al menos, en una etapa de una aplicación concreta. En cada módulo, usted encontrará:\n- videos explicativos\n- un laboratorio no calificado\n- un laboratorio calificado\n- un cuestionario calificado.\n\nLos laboratorios son espacios para desarrollar tareas en lenguaje Python. No esperamos que usted sea un experto desarrollador de programas en Python, pero sí que tenga algún tipo de experticia en programación. \n\n¿Para quién es este curso? Hemos imaginado este curso teniendo en mente dos posibles perfiles:\n1) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos sobre el sector energético que quiere explorar qué puede aprovechar de la ciencia de datos; y\n2) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos en ciencia de datos que quiere explorar cómo puede aportar esos conocimientos en el área del sector energético. Por ej.: Este curso está dedicado principalmente a estudiantes universitarios de primer y segundo año interesados en ciencia e ingeniería, junto con estudiantes de secundaria y profesionales interesados en programación."

During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  \n\nThis course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge."

The aim of this course is to explore different circular design frameworks such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's collaboration with IDEO to create a Circular Product Design Guide, the partnership between industry and research teams that culminated in the CIRCit Guide to Circular Product Design and Development, and Biomimicry 3.8's Guide to best practices. If the first two courses in the specialization describe what circular product and packaging design is and what it can achieve, this course is about the processes and methodologies necessary to make it happen.The course begins by examining the motivation for circular product design, highlighting what is happening at major corporations such as IKEA, as well as for regulatory mandates, such as the European Union's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (the ESPR). The course then dives into the Ellen MacArthur Foundation-IDEO's 4-Phase Design Guide based on human-centered design and design thinking. The Circular Product Design approach defined by the CIRCit Project is also examined in detail, as it dovetails nicely into existing stage-gate product development processes. The course then briefly discusses biomimicry as an innovative way to emulate nature's solutions to today's challenges. Increasingly, consumers (and investors!) are interested in more sustainable and circular products, and one way of demonstrating a company's success is with a 3rd party certification. Therefore, the course wraps up with a focus on the Cradle-to-Cradle Products Innovation Institute’s certification process. Included in this course is a comprehensive set of tools, worksheets, and activities that can be used by any product design team interested in developing circular products that benefit both people and the environment.\n\nThis course was developed in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of the \"Design for the Circular Economy\" collection. Learners who complete and pass the course can receive an industry-recognized digital badge.\n\nThe “Design for the Circular Economy” microcredential and graduate certificate are developed around the educational goals of providing technical, business, and leadership knowledge and skills that inspire the transformation towards a more circular economy. This includes gaining technical knowledge to apply circular economy principles in product design, minimizing waste and maximizing impact; developing business acumen to implement innovative circular economic models that prioritize sustainability and resilience; and acquiring leadership strategies to communicate effectively and inspire change within an organization. \n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the ME-EM is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience.

It is organized around five key modules: (1) Why Cities Matter,  (2) A World of Cities,  (3) The Creative City, (4) The Divided City and the New Urban Crisis, and (5) How to Find the Best Place for You.\n\n After completing the course, you will be able to:\n\n\n(1) Identify why cities are the drivers of economic prosperity;\n(2) Explain the drivers and implications of fast-growing urbanization worldwide;\n(3) Outline the key characteristics of a creative and innovative city;\n(4) Describe the social divides and challenges facing cities and the solutions cities are using to address them; and\n(5) Recognize the trade-offs of staying in your current city versus moving, and identify the best place for you and your family to live.\n\nOf course the world has changed a great deal since I developed this course. The Global COVID-19 Pandemic is affecting cities, businesses and people around the world. It is something I have been writing about and working with mayors, city managers, economic developers, urban leaders and communities across the globe. I have put together a new module on Cities and the Coronavirus to help you better understand the ways in which the Covid-19 crisis is impacting cities and how you can best understand  and deal with that.\n\nI’d like to wish each and every one of you good luck as you get started on this journey. I hope you enjoy the course!"

Con una concentración de personas cada vez mayor viviendo en contextos urbanos, las ciudades son hoy el escenario de un apasionante cambio de época que afecta la esfera social, política, económica y tecnológica ¿A qué nos referimos cuando hablamos de políticas urbanas y qué las distingue de otros ámbitos de las políticas públicas? ¿Cuáles son los principales factores de vulnerabilidad urbana y qué respuestas se están articulando en forma de políticas urbanas? ¿Cómo surge la innovación en la ciudad, tanto desde la base como desde las administraciones públicas? Y, finalmente, ¿qué efectos ha tenido la irrupción de la era digital en la ciudad?"
