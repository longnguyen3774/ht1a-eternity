You must be aware that the human impact on biodiversity and global change are two of the most important discussion points in environmental science. Have you ever wondered how we are affecting global change and biodiversity? How can we reconcile human population growth, resource demands and sustainability? The effects of global change on humans and natural ecosystems and additional factors in evaluating personal environmental impact will also be discussed in this course."

In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus. \n\nWe're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!"

How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.\n\nEpigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros.

But what can they do about them?In this course, you will be invited to reflect on whether, in what sense and to what extent, 2500 years of normative epistemology, or theory of knowledge, can be put into practice and help to reduce truth decay. You’ll be invited, more specifically, to reflect on\n- the theory of knowledge,\n- the analysis of knowledge,\n- the possibility of knowledge,\n- the structure of knowledge,\n- the kinds of knowledge, and\n- the value of knowledge.\nThink of a pressing example of truth decay that strikes you and wonder how epistemology may go against it."

Our course starts with introductory lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training exercises. \n\n* Do I need prior knowledge?\nThe course is suitable for (advanced undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering, and data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course requires some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed in the Building Blocks module. If you are searching for a MOOC on econometrics of a more introductory nature that needs less background in mathematics, you may be interested in the Coursera course “Enjoyable Econometrics” that is also from Erasmus University Rotterdam.\n\n* What literature can I consult to support my studies?\nYou can follow the MOOC without studying additional sources. Further reading of the discussed topics (including the Building Blocks) is provided in the textbook that we wrote and on which the MOOC is based: Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics, Oxford University Press. The connection between the MOOC modules and the book chapters is shown in the Course Guide – Further Information – How can I continue my studies.\n\n* Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course?\nStaff and PhD students of our Econometric Institute will provide guidance in January and February of each year. In other periods, we provide only elementary guidance. We always advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss topics and exercises.\n\n* How will I get a certificate?\nTo gain the certificate of this course, you are asked to make six Test Exercises (one per module) and a Case Project. Further, you perform peer-reviewing activities of the work of three of your fellow learners of this MOOC. You gain the certificate if you pass all seven assignments.\n\nHave a nice journey into the world of Econometrics!\nThe Econometrics team"

ERPOs are legally issued civil orders that allow people on the front lines to ask a court to prevent a person at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing firearms during a critical period of risk. As of October 2020, ERPO laws have been enacted by nineteen states and the District of Columbia and while some aspects differ by state, the general process for applying and issuing ERPOs are quite similar.In this Teach-Out, a team of public health, policy, and medical experts will each provide a unique perspective to:\n \n1. Define what ERPO laws are and how they work;\n2. Share scientific evidence supporting ERPO laws as a public health approach to preventing gun violence and suicide;\n3. Describe specific considerations for those eligible to petition for (aka those who ask the court to issue) ERPOs on behalf of an individual—including law enforcement, health professionals, and personal family members;\n4. Discuss the legal process for passing, implementing, and enforcing ERPO laws; \n5. Recommend specific call to action activities for learners designed to encourage policy makers to implement ERPO laws in states without them and strengthen existing ERPO laws in states that already have them; and \n6. Provide opportunities for learners to engage in civil discourse and collective action to increase awareness about ERPOs and empower learners to advocate for ERPO laws to reduce and prevent gun violence in our communities."

    "content": "Essentials of Global Health is a comprehensive introduction to global health. It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.ESSENTIALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tArticulate key public health concepts related to global health;\n•\tAnalyze the key issues in global health from a number of perspectives;\t\n•\tDiscuss with confidence the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex, age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden can be addressed in cost-effective ways;\n•\tAssess key health disparities, especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people in low- and middle-income countries; \n•\tOutline the key actors and organizations in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical global health concerns;\n•\tReview key global health challenges that are likely to arise in the coming decades.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nValue Added of the Course\n\nThe course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive, by handling each  topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health issues and what can be done to address them.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health\n\nFor almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: \n\n- Required readings\n- Recommended readings\n- Recommended videos\n\nWe have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.\n\nFor each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nIn addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session. \n\nThe first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.\n\nThe second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nLearners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.\n\nWe have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening."

    "content": "Liderazgo es una palabra que se usa para muchas cosas diferentes y a veces opuestas. Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita trabajar para llegar a la solución.En este curso vamos a preguntarnos ¿qué concepción de liderazgo y qué tipo de habilidades son útiles para el complejo y cambiante mundo en el que vivimos?, ¿cómo se aprenden estas habilidades?, ¿para qué tipo de desafíos es necesario el liderazgo?, ¿qué recursos de poder y formas de autoridad hacen parte del liderazgo y cuáles no?, ¿qué riesgos tiene la práctica del liderazgo?, ¿cómo te proteges?.\n \nVamos a invitarte a que, en el espacio virtual y en tu vida real, adquieras una perspectiva potente, unas “Gafas Efectivas” para mirar el mundo complejo en el que vives, diagnosticar los desafíos que te importan y planear intervenciones para avanzar en ellos. En otras palabras, el curso te acompaña en el proceso de adueñarte de una metodología de diagnóstico e intervención, que llamamos Espiral de Liderazgo Consciente, que te va ayudar a identificar y caracterizar:\n\n1. Tus propósitos\n2. Los desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentas para llegar a ellos\n3. Los aspectos técnicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades, que tienen que ver con reglas, dinero, conocimiento, expertos y autoridades formales\n4. Los aspectos humanos y sistémicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades: que tienen que ver con las personas interesadas y afectadas, sus valores, miedos, las facciones que forman y a veces pelean entre sí, la probabilidad de que sean aliados o detractores\n5. Tus recursos formales e informales (y desafíos internos) que afectan el tema que quieres avanzar, y los riesgos del liderazgo que probablemente enfrentarás\n\nTodo ello para que planees intervenciones y experimentos de avance, y reflexiones sobre cómo protegerte (pensando en el sistema, haciendo alianzas, reflexionando en la acción, escuchando a las facciones, gestionando tus emociones, etc)\n \nVamos a invitarte también a observar y profundizar tu habilidad para estar presente y para reflexionar y aprender antes, durante y después de hacer alguna intervención dirigida a mejorar tus resultados personales o de grupo. En otras palabras, vamos a acompañarte a profundizar en tres herramientas que llamamos “Estoy Aquí”;  “Subir al Balcón” y “Parada para respirar” que tienen que ver con meta-observar al mundo, a ti mismo en el mundo y a tu mundo interior y encontrar la respuesta a preguntas como: ¿cómo te sientes cuando estás intensamente presente en una actividad (o en un sistema en el que quieres intervenir para cambiar los resultados)?, ¿cuáles son los mecanismos por los que se dispersa tu atención y las justificaciones que te das a ti mismo para dejar de estar presente?, ¿qué está pasando en el mundo externo?, ¿qué está pasando en tu interior?.\n \nEstos objetivos de aprendizaje implican que el curso al que vas a entrar no está diseñado de forma convencional, como clases magistrales en las que un experto te “enseña” conceptos, sino que el rol de los profesores en este curso es el de diseñar oportunidades de aprendizaje para ti, y acompañarte a que reflexiones sobre ellas.\n \n\"Estilos de Liderazgo: Opciones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos\" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/estilos-liderazgo/home/welcome) es el primero de cuatro cursos que componen el programa especializado en \"Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI\" (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/liderazgo-efectivo). Los otros tres cursos son: \"Autoliderazgo y Gestión de Emociones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos\"; \"Comunicación, Experimentación y Aprendizaje en Liderazgo\"; y \"Liderazgo para el siglo XXI\". Puedes tomar todos los cursos por separado o sólo uno de ellos, sin embargo te recomendamos que te inscribas y participes en los cuatro, ojalá en el orden que te proponemos.\n\nEn general, todo el programa está dirigido a cualquier persona interesada en conectarse con sus propósitos y profundizar sus habilidades para progresar en desafíos personales y colectivos muy complejos. Es especialmente útil para personas en mandos medios y altos en organizaciones públicas, privadas y no gubernamentales (ONGs). También para líderes comunitarios, activistas y en general gente que trabaja con personas y que necesita desarrollar o profundizar habilidades y herramientas para crear, a partir de grupos con opiniones e intereses diversos comunidades que trabajan juntas para avanzar en los temas que les importan. Va a ser útil, también, para personas interesadas en aprender a mejorar los resultados que observan en su esfera de vida más personal."

This course will help you learn about the role that ethical, moral, and cultural principles play when lawmakers and public officials formulate and execute public policy.This course draws upon classical writings in political theory and contemporary cases on ethical dilemmas in public policymaking. It will enable you to debate various ethics themes such as justice, equality, fairness, individual liberty, free enterprise, charity, human rights, and minimising harm to others. It will also help you grasp how these themes integrate into various decision-making models, such as the utilitarian approach, fairness and justice approach, and rights approach. This course will help you examine these models in a real-life context to help balance competing interests to make the best decision.  \n\nIn this course, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges that stand at the crossroads between moral and practical decision-making as a real-life practitioner. You will find answers to questions such as if tolerance is a virtue in public policies that risk challenging constitutional norms, what could be the ethical implications of state violence in the name of national interest, and if it would be a good ethical policy to building dams to generate electricity for more people by displacing the inhabitants of that area. With the help of case studies, this course will help you dive deep into the dilemmas faced by the policymakers (both elected and appointed). It will also help you find some middle-ground that is morally just and optimizes social purpose."

    "content": "There is an increasing attention to ethics in engineering practice. Engineers are supposed not only to carry out their work competently and skilfully, but also to be aware of the broader ethical and social implications of engineering and to be able to reflect on these.  According to the Engineering Criteria 2000 of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, engineers must have “an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” and should \"understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context.”This course provides an introduction to ethics in engineering and technology. It helps engineers and students in engineering to acquire the competences mentioned in the ABET criteria or comparable criteria formulated in other countries. More specifically, this course helps engineers to acquire the following moral competencies:\n\n- Moral sensibility: the ability to recognize social and ethical issues in engineering;\n- Moral analysis skills: the ability to analyse moral problems in terms of facts, values, stakeholders and their interests;\n- Moral creativity: the ability to think out different options for action in the light of (conflicting) moral values and the relevant facts;\n- Moral judgement skills: the ability to give a moral judgement on the basis of different ethical theories or frameworks including professional ethics and common sense morality;\n- Moral decision-making skills: the ability to reflect on different ethical theories and frameworks and to make a decision based on that reflection.\n\nWith respect to these competencies, our focus is on the concrete moral problems that engineers encounter in their professional practice. With the help of concrete cases is shown how the decision to develop a technology, as well as the process of design and production, is inherently moral. The attention of the learners is drawn towards the specific moral choices that engineers face. In relation to these concrete choices learners will encounter different reasons for and against certain actions, and they will discover that these reasons can be discussed. In this way, learners become aware of the moral dimensions of technology and acquire the argumentative capacities that are needed in moral debates with stakeholders (e.g. governments, users, and commercial business departments)."

D’Aristote à Kant, de Bentham à Derrida, à travers un voyage philosophique passionnant nous entrerons dans le vif du débat éthique contemporain.\n\nNotre monde toujours plus complexe semble nous échapper. Réchauffement climatique, questions de début et de fin de vie, évolution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, inégale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentuées… La tentation est grande d’une vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ». Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.\nC’est pourquoi nous présentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.\n\nQuels que soient votre champ de savoir académique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s’agit de proposer des clés d’analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les présentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées pour mieux comprendre le réel et mieux orienter l’action.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAbout this course:\n\nThis course presents the main schools of thought that frame today’s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: \"do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others\". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.\n\n- - - - - - - - -- - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - -- \n善、正义、功用：哲学伦理学导论\n \n本课程旨在向大家介绍伦理学的主要流派，这些流派对如今的伦理思考意义非凡，并且涉及到每个人的个人生活、社会生活和公民生活。\n从亚里士多德到康德，从边沁到德里达，通过引人入胜的哲学之旅，我们将进入当代伦理学辩论的核心问题。"

This course examines the development, the scope and the challenges of European Citizenship.The course has a threefold aim: to explore the development, application and current challenges of European citizenship. This aim is examined through three modules. The first module focuses on the development of European Citizenship: What are the substantive rights of citizenship beyond the state, and which institutions have been key to their development? Here, we focus on free movement for persons, cross-border welfare, and political rights – especially the European Citizens' Initiative. The second module focuses on the application of EU citizenship: How is EU citizenship practised? Is EU citizenship limited or extensive when compared to the US federal system, for example? Is it still foremost a right for those who move from member state to member state, but not for those who stay in their member state of origin? Finally, the third module examines the extent to which the rules and rights around European citizenship have been contested and politicized during the last decade. In this part of the course, we also look into the de-Europeanisation of citizenship through Brexit. \n \nThe course is funded by Erasmus+ and developed by the 4EU+ University Alliance, consisting of six European Universities: Univerzita Karlova, Universität Heidelberg, Sorbonne Université, Københavns Universitet, Università degli studi di Milano, Uniwersytet Warszawski."

With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faculty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\n\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme. For more information about the Master’s programme in European Business Law see https://www.law.lu.se/#!meb"

In medicine and healthcare, evidence-based medicine has revolutionized the way that information is evaluated transparently and objectively. Over the past ten years, a movement in North America and Europe has attempted to translate this revolution to the field of toxicology.The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) within the department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health hosts the first chair for EBT and the secretariat for the EBT Collaboration on both sides of the Atlantic. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration in Evidence-based Medicine, the EBT Collaboration was established at the CAAT to foster the development of a process for quality assurance of new toxicity tests for the assessment of safety in humans and the environment.\nRegulatory safety sciences have undergone remarkably little change in the past fifty years. At the same time, our knowledge in the life sciences is doubling about every seven years. Systematic review and related evidence-based approaches are beginning to be adapted by regulatory agencies like the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the US National Toxicology Program. They provide transparent, objective, and consistent tools to identify, select, appraise, and extract evidence across studies. \nThis course will showcase these emerging efforts and address opportunities and challenges to the expanded use of these tools within toxicology."

    "content": "In an age now driven by \"big data\", we need to cut through the noise and present key information in a way that can be quickly consumed and acted upon making data visualization an increasingly important skill. Visualizations need to not only present data in an easy to understand and attractive way, but they must also provide context for the data, tell a story, achieving that fine balance between form and function. Excel has many rivals in this space, but it is still an excellent choice, particularly if it's where your data resides. It offers a wealth of tools for creating visualizations other than charts and the chart options available are constantly increasing and improving, so the newer versions now include waterfall charts, sunburst diagrams and even map charts. But what sets Excel apart is its flexibility, it gives us total creative control over our designs so if needed we could produce our own animated custom chart to tell the right story for our data.Over five weeks we will explore Excel's rich selection of visualization tools using practical case studies as seen through the eyes of Rohan, an environmental analyst. Rohan is required to produce visualizations that will show trends, forecasts, breakdowns and comparisons for a large variety of environmental data sets. As well as utilising the usual chart types he wants to use conditional formats, sparklines, specialised charts and even create his own animated charts and infographics. In some cases, he will also need to prepare the data using pivot tables to drill down and answer very specific questions. We are going to help him achieve all this and present our finished visualizations in attractive reports and dashboards that use tools like slicers and macros for automation and interactivity.\n\nThese are the topics we will cover:\nWeek 1: \tDynamic visualizations with conditional formatting, custom number formatting, sparklines and macros\nWeek 2: \tCharting techniques for telling the right story\nWeek 3: \tCreating specialised and custom charts\nWeek 4: \tSummarising and filtering data with pivot tables and pivot charts\nWeek 5: \tCreating interactive dashboards in Excel\n\nThis is the second course in our Specialization on Data Analytics and Visualization. The first course: Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis, covers data preparation and cleaning but also teaches some of the prerequisites for this course like tables and named ranges as well as text, lookup and logical functions. To get the most out of this course we would recommend you do the first course or have experience with these topics. In this course we focus on Data Visualization in Excel, join us for this exciting journey."

In this four-week course, we introduce Power Query, Power Pivot and Power BI, three power tools for transforming, analysing and presenting data.Excel's ease and flexibility have long made it a tool of choice for doing data analysis, but it does have some inherent limitations: for one, truly \"big\" data simply does not fit in a spreadsheet and for another, the process of importing and cleaning data can be a repetitive, time-consuming and error-prone. Over the last few years, Microsoft have worked on transforming the end-to-end experience for analysts, and Excel has undergone a major upgrade with the inclusion of Power Query and Power Pivot.\n\nIn this course, we will learn how to use Power Query to automate the process of importing and preparing data for analysis. We will see how Power Pivot revolutionises the actual analysis process by providing us with an analytical database inside the Excel workbook, capable of storing millions of rows, and a powerful modelling language called DAX which allows us to perform advanced analytics on our data. We will finish off by venturing out of Excel and introducing Power BI, which also uses the Power Query and Power BI architecture but allows us to create stunning interactive reports and dashboards.\n\nThis is the third course in our Specialization on Data Analytics and Visualization. The previous courses: Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis and Data Visualization in Excel, cover data preparation, cleaning, visualisation, and creating dashboards. To get the most out of this course we would recommend you do the previous courses or have experience with these topics.

This in turns allows us to build more detailed quantitative models of cellular function, which can give important insight into applications ranging from biotechnology to human disease. This course gives a broad overview of a variety of current experimental techniques used in modern systems biology, with focus on obtaining the quantitative data needed for computational modeling purposes in downstream analyses. We dive deeply into four technologies in particular, mRNA sequencing, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, flow/mass cytometry, and live-cell imaging. These techniques are often used in systems biology and range from genome-wide coverage to single molecule coverage, millions of cells to single cells, and single time points to frequently sampled time courses. We present not only the theoretical background upon which these technologies work, but also enter real wet lab environments to provide instruction on how these techniques are performed in practice, and how resultant data are analyzed for quality and content."

    "content": "This course will help you learn how fossils give us an insight into how the early members of our lineage walked bipedally. The four million years old bone of Australopithecus anamensis is the oldest undisputed evidence for bipedalism in our lineage. Similarly, Lucy’s, who was Australopithecus afarensis, fossil also helped scientists discover a lot about how bipedalism evolved over time. You will also explore bipedal variations in humans. From its earliest version to its modern form—how humans learned to walk, is an interesting story. Similarly how a human being learns to walk, from a toddler’s first footstep to an adult human being’s walk and its variations would also be discussed in this course. You will also understand that while bipedalism has its advantages, it has its adverse effects on humans too from a musculoskeletal point of view.Every module of this course has been created with the intention of a “hands-on” learner experience, where you can play around with and learn from 3D renditions of different human and animal fossils. Through these exercises, you will read the shapes found in bones in order to analyze and reconstruct how a species moved."

Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch, and UdK composer Mathias Hinke, this course is also co-taught by scholar and musician Jace Clayton (DJ Rupture) and curator Candice Hopkins (Documenta 14). The lectures link major artistic developments of recent decades to wider ideas about sound in specific social and spatial contexts.Also included are guest presentations from key thinkers and practitioners, like: Christopher DeLaurenti, Jen Delos Reyes, Tina Haver Currin, Quran Karriem, Christina Kubisch, Thomas Kusitzky, Scott Lindroth, Mark Anthony Neal, Bill Seaman, and John Supko. As the ‘ART of the MOOC’ title implies, learners and participants are encouraged to treat the MOOC itself as a public art medium. This happens mostly through the course’s optional practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback. While no prior sound production or musical experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners. \n\nFor other course offerings or language versions in this series, just search 'ART of the MOOC' in the Coursera catalog."

This includes our living and working environments, diet, social support and stress, pollution, and exposure to infectious agents. Exposome research is about discovering the non-genetic drivers of health and disease.Derived from the term exposure, the Exposome represents the totality of exposures we face throughout our lifetime. It also represents the biological responses that arise from external exposures. \n\nIn this course, 7 researchers from Utrecht University and/or the NWO Gravitation programme Exposome-NL will offer their expertise. We will introduce you to the Exposome concept; why it’s important; how we measure the exposome; and the data sciences steps needed to establish associations with health outcomes. This course will conclude with reflections on what is needed to advance this nascent and transformative field of research. \n\nExposome research requires transdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, this MOOC will be of interest to current and prospective students and researchers in the fields of public health, environmental health, life sciences, clinical medicine, geosciences, humanities, and social and behavioural sciences."
