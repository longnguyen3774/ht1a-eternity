Historically, drugs were discovered serendipitously and were usually isolated from natural sources. Today, drug discovery efforts take many years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They also require the input of dozens of specialists from a multitude of backgrounds to ensure that therapeutic molecules are efficacious and safe.This four-week course takes a high-level tour of what it takes to research and develop a new drug. We will meet different scientists and professionals across the drug discovery value chain as we explore the different stages of discovery and development, including the different tools and technologies that are influencing how we think about new medicines today. \n\nStarting off with the needs of the patient and the early phases of drug discovery, we will cover drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics and drug safety all the way to clinical development and beyond. This course is relevant for scientists who are new to drug discovery research or already have some experience, health professionals, or anyone who is interested in knowing what had to happen to ensure that their medicine is effective and safe."

How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?Behavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices. Learn how to improve your spending, saving, and investing decisions for the future."

The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems.\n\nThis course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories: 1) ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models."

Our goal is to change all this with the course you are about to view, produced by Dr. Sally Shaywitz, the Audrey G. Ratner Professor in Learning Development, both the leading scientist studying dyslexia and the most devoted advocate for helping those who are dyslexic.The course addresses and answers just about all the questions you have: beginning with what is reading and what is dyslexia and sharing with you the most up-to-date 21st century federal definition of dyslexia. If you are dyslexic, you’ll come to learn you are not alone – dyslexia is very common affecting one out of five, that is, 20% of the population, including both boys and girls all over the world. The course addresses a major question we hear from so many parents and teachers– how do I know if my child may be dyslexic? What signs or symptoms should I be on the lookout for? And here’s another very important question we hear from so many parents and educators who are eager to do the best for their child – when should screening for dyslexia begin? What is the best method? What should I look for or ask about?\n\nA major source of worry for parents is their child’s slow reading- they ask will this prevent a happy future for the child. Yes, dyslexics are slow readers and here, in Coursera, you will come to understand the brain’s role in dyslexia, including slow reading. Great news to share – you will also be so delighted to learn that surrounding a dyslexic’s slow reading is a phenomenal powerful sea of strengths in big picture thinking and reasoning. Dyslexia is a true paradox: dyslexics may be slow readers but at the same time are incredibly fast thinkers! \n\nYou can be assured, if you care about a child or someone who is dyslexic and have questions or concerns, you will find it addressed here in this course: everything important to know about and help you select the most effective interventions for a dyslexic child; how to go about choosing the best school, including potentially one that is specialized, for such a child, including what is most important to look for when visiting a potential school; the role of accommodations and how to select the best one; and common co-occurring conditions like ADHD and anxiety – their impact, how to recognize and treat. In the following lessons you will meet wonderful, incredibly insightful and highly successful dyslexics – including governors, cardiac surgeons, nationally renowned attorneys, basketball coaches, economists and dyslexic children and their wonderful families who will share their experiences and advice. Enjoy!"

    "content": "This course is multidisciplinary in nature, and aims to equip the global audience of interested lay people, people with chronic disease, public health researchers, health clinicians, students, administrators, and researchers to reflect on the overall impact of the burden of chronic disease . It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related.The Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. \n\nThe course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. \n\nThe entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. \n\nWhat you'll learn: \n-\tHow the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease\n-\tHow a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem\n-\tThe fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading\n-\tThe biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence\n-\tThe biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors\n-\tHow to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease"

This partnership can inspire work for the wellbeing of the Earth communityThere is a need for broader literacy and deeper knowledge of the world’s religions and their ecological contributions. This specialization, \"Religions and Ecology: Restoring the Earth Community\", contributes such a perspective. Each course celebrates the vitality of religiously-informed action for the Earth and recognizes the longstanding contributions of Indigenous peoples in offering visions and practices for ecological flourishing. \n\nThis course is part 4 of 5 of the \"Religions and Ecology: Restoring the Earth Community\" specialization that focuses on the ecological dimensions of religious traditions throughout the world.\n\nThe course you are about to begin is designed as a gateway to these aspects of the East Asian religions, philosophies, and practices of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, Shinto, and Shamanism. So much has emerged in the last several decades in this area, as you will see. While we have taught this course at Yale, we have adapted it for learners from a wide range of backgrounds.\n\nThis course is for lifelong learners curious to know more about world religions and ecology, environmental professionals eager to deepen the discourse of environmental protection and conservation, those working with non-profit organizations and NGOs on issues of ecological justice, and religion leaders and laity who wish to know how they can contribute to interreligious dialogue on environmental projects."

We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.\n\nThe Role of Developing Countries\nWith that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?\n  \nA MOOC to Respond to these Questions\nThis free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:\n• Researchers from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris\n• Field experts from the Agence Française de Développement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,\n• Carbone 4 founder Alain Grandjean, who will share his experience, in particular on the economic and financial aspects.\n \nHere is the program: \n1.       Our development model is ecologically unsustainable\n2.       The dominant economic models hinder the energy and ecological transition\n3.       The energy transition path: decarbonizing GDP\n4.       The model of an ecological transition to new prosperity\n5.       Governance of the energy and ecological transition\n6.

    "content": "En el contexto actual de emergencia climática y escasez de recursos es necesario empezar a replantear que papel es el que ejerce la economía. Hasta el momento, el desarrollo económico ha estado basado en un crecimiento continuo basado en el uso de recursos naturales sin tener en cuenta las consecuencias derivadas de su uso ineficientes, y los impactos ambientales que generan en el medio ambiente.Frente a esta situación, desde hace unos años se ha intensificado el debate sobre cómo debería ser la economía para permitir un desarrollo más sustentable. Uno de los conceptos que ha ganado fuerza es el de la Economía Circular, que sirviéndose de la investigación desarrollada desde finales de 1970’s se inspira para plantear productos, y sistemas industriales y urbanos más respetuosos con el medio ambiente. La economía circular, pues, no es un concepto del todo nuevo. Representa una nueva forma de entender y analizar sistemas actuales, y de promover sistemas y productos más respetuosos con el medio ambiente.\nEn este curso aprenderás lo fundamentos de la economía circular, las cifras actuales que demuestran la necesidad de avanzar hacia sistemas y productos circulares, y sobre todo las herramientas básicas para poder analizar los sistemas socioeconómicos actuales.\nLa estructura del curso contempla 5 sesiones, cada uno requiere una dedicación de unas 4 horas de estudio y práctica. La primera sesión explica las distintas escuelas de pensamiento que han servido para desarrollar el concepto de la Economía Circular. Durant la segunda sesión, os mostraré cuales son los compromisos políticos y los planes de acción en EC en Europa que se están implementando para mejorar ambientalmente la economía actual. Las tres sesiones siguientes describen los fundamentos básicos para analizar un sistema y producto desde un punto de vista físico. Después de hacer una introducción sobre los principios de termodinámica, y de conservación de la materia, aprenderás como se usan para el análisis de sistemas. También hablaremos sobre el ecodiseño o diseño para el medio ambiente, y finalmente de cómo algunas de estas herramientas se aplican conjuntamente.\nEl curso está orientado a profesionales en medio ambiente y gestión de empresas, también universitarios de pregrado y estudiantes de posgrado y tecnólogos."

    "content": "Being aware of the urgency and importance of climate change is not enough to tackle it effectively. To avoid the worst climate outcomes, decisive action has to be taken. But what realistic options do we have? Since our resources are limited, is it better to act now or wait until we have more advanced and less expensive technology? How big do our abatement efforts have to be?This MOOC will help you understand how economists try to answer these questions and find the optimal course of action. Most important, it will give you the conceptual tools to draw your own conclusions.\n\nIn the first part of the MOOC, you will learn about the two main approaches used by economists to determine when and how much we should invest in the fight against climate change. The first method is the net-present-value approach. Here the social discount rate plays a central role in determining optimal policy, by showing how future benefits and costs can be compared and made comparable (‘present-valued’) with expenditures today. In the  second approach you will learn how Integrated Assessment  Models (IAMs) work. In particular, you will study in detail the strengths and weaknesses of one of the most popular IAMs, the DICE model, developed by Nobel laureate Professor Nordhaus. This model tries to figure out the optimal course of action by providing a simplified account of the science, the technology and the economics of the problem.\n\nThe second part of this MOOC then explores the different types of economic policies that decision-makers can adopt. You will be introduced to different methods used to control emissions, such as carbon taxes, regulations and standard-setting. You will also learn about the most developed emissions trading markets around the world and their effects on the economy.\n\nThis MOOC is for those who wish to understand the economics of climate change and use this understanding to form their own informed opinion about the policies on which we can rely to tackle it. It is not necessary to have specialized prior knowledge, apart from basic familiarity with economic concepts such as utility functions. We do suggest, however, taking the first MOOC of this specialization before starting this one in order to gain a simple but solid understanding of the physical and technological aspects of the problems."

Il a été préparé par un économiste rattaché à un institut d'architecture, qui possède une expérience de plus de 20 ans d'enseignement des bases de l'analyse économique, en particulier pour l'immobilier, à des étudiant-e-s qui ne sont pas des économistes.Le cours vous apportera des connaissances économiques vous permettant de comprendre de nombreux mécanismes de nos économies marchandes, comme la concurrence, la formation des prix, les équilibres et déséquilibres. Il fournit aussi des connaissances de base en analyse financière. Il est surtout utile pour qui veut se lancer dans l'investissement immobilier, le montage d'opérations immobilières, l'analyse de faisabilité économique de projets de construction, etc. Il peut même vous aider à préparer l'achat d'une maison ou d'un appartement pour votre propre usage!\n\nLe cours \"Economie du sol et de l'immobilier\" en deux parties vous permettra de comprendre\n(1) les calculs des acteurs des marchés foncier et immobilier (propriétaires fonciers, investisseurs immobiliers, etc.)\n(2) comment se forment les prix sur ces marchés, en lien avec le marché du logement et les politiques publiques\nLa première partie introduit les principales méthodes de calcul des valeurs foncières et immobilières. Le cours est illustré d'exemples et de statistiques principalement suisses.\n\nDans ce premier cours (Economie du sol et de l'immobilier I), nous aborderons:\n•\tLes calculs d'arbitrage et les déterminants et composantes du taux de rendement\n•\tLa détermination du consentement à payer des acheteurs\n•\tLa concurrence entre acheteurs\n•\tLe point de vue du propriétaire foncier\n•\tLes méthodes de calcul des valeurs immobilières\n\nIl est vivement recommandé d'effectuer les deux parties du cours dans l'ordre, puisque la deuxième utilise les concepts développés dans la première. Les deux parties sont de difficulté comparable.\n\nChaque partie est structurée en modules hebdomadaires. Chaque module compte 5 ou 6 vidéos expliquant un thème. Chaque vidéo est suivie d'un quiz permettant de vérifier les concepts de la vidéo. Ces quiz demandent des calculs algébriques et numériques qui peuvent facilement être réalisés avec une calculatrice, mieux encore avec un tableur. Un formulaire est proposé en entrée du cours pour rappeler les opérations mathématiques utilisées dans le cours. Il s'agit principalement de manipuler des équations pour en extraire le terme recherché. A la fin de chaque module, il y a un quiz d'évaluation, qui doit être réussi avant de passer au module suivant. Ce quiz est fait de petits problèmes semblables à ceux qui ont été résolus dans les quiz d'exercice."

They play a multitude of roles - including in relation to humanitarian assistance, service-delivery, research and policy development, and pursuing accountability from governments and other stakeholders – all of which can significantly contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CSOs are expected to play a critical role in implementing the SDGs and in monitoring their progress. It is therefore urgent that CSOs meaningfully and effectively engage in development processes. But what is needed for CSOs to be able to do so? This Online Interactive Guidance offers some answers to that question. It takes participants through a history of the international commitments that call for this multi-stakeholder collaboration; what this means in practice for different development actors; and the benefits that can ensue through means of good practice examples from countries across the globe.Learning objectives\nFollowing the completion of the 5 modules of the Online Interactive Guidance, participants will be able to:\n•\tDescribe the rationale behind the need to engage civil society in development processes;\n•\tDefine the CSO enabling environment and CSO development effectiveness as key components to ensuring \n         effective engagement of CSOs in development;\n•\tRecall the international commitments on the CSO enabling environment and CSO development \n         effectiveness;\n•\tDistinguish the roles and responsibilities of different development actors in ensuring effective engagement \n        of CSOs in development;\n•\tIdentify practical ways in which governments, donors and civil society can engage to create a CSO enabling \n        environment and ensure CSO development effectiveness;\n•\tIdentify good practices for a CSO enabling environment and development effectiveness;\n•\tIndicate the benefits that can ensue from implementing good practices;\n•\tTranslate the international commitments and apply these to their own context.\n\nMethodology\nThis Online Interactive Guidance consists of five modules developed around the overall learning objectives. Each module starts with an animated video introducing the topic and is followed by good practice examples; insights from the field in the form of video interviews; in-depth readings; and an online activity. \n\nSet-up\nThe Online Guidance will lead participants through the modules that each play a part in creating an environment in which CSOs can meaningfully and effectively contribute to implementation and monitoring of international development processes. \n> Module 1 will examine the CSO-related commitments that the international community has subscribed to and will provide an introduction to the four ways in which these can be realized. \n> Module 2 will explore the means towards creating effective multi-stakeholder dialogue, which is key to creating a CSO enabling environment. \n> Module 3 will examine CSOs’ own responsibility in ensuring their effectiveness, accountability and transparency in their day-to-day operations.\n> Module 4 will delve into how providers of official development cooperation can effectively work with and for CSOs. \n> Module 5 is the concluding module and will examine how a country’s rules and regulations can determine an enabling environment for CSOs to operate in. \n\nCompletion\nParticipants who have completed the 5 modules can request a certificate extended by the Task Team on CSO Development Effectiveness & Enabling Environment."

    "content": "In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a twenty-six year old patent clerk, introduced in his “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?About the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the Director of Academic Programs at Stanford University’s Center for Professional Development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science. He holds degrees in physics, mathematics, and the history of science, has published a book and a TED Ed video on \"Young Einstein: From the Doxerl Affair to the Miracle Year,\" and has had over 30,000 students worldwide enroll in his online course on the special theory of relativity (this course!)."

    "content": "For three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.But what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7. Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nRelated Resources\n--------------------------------\n\nOnline resources are available here:\nhttps://newlearningonline.com\n\n--------------------------------\nJoin our Online Communities!\n--------------------------------\n\nCGScholar (Create an account and join the New Learning community)\nhttps://cgscholar.com/community/community_profiles/new-learning/community_updates\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/newlearningonline\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/neolearning\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the Assessment for Learning course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer from low retention rates.

Within these lecture notes, we review vector calculus and explain how to use fields to visualize the topics we cover.  This course is dynamic, as the lectures continuously build on previous notes and a variety of explanations are presented for each solution.  Since this is a lower level course, we will focus on the simple concept of electrostatics.  This has applications in exploring intermolecular forces, and qualities of capacitors.  Through this, we relate electromagnetism to more conventionally studied topics and its application to specific research topics related to energy storage and harvesting."

    "content": "Before the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, most scientists believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts. For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about that system’s future.However, there are some systems that defy this notion. Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected, surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called XaoS 3.4, which is distributed by the Free Software Foundation under a GNU General Public License.\n\nUpon completing this course, you will be able to:\n1.       Explain the difference in assumptions between an emergent versus reductive approach to science.\n2.       Explain why the reductivist approach is understood by many to be inadequate as a means of describing and predicting complex systems.\n3.       Describe how the length scale used to examine a phenomenon can contribute to how you analyze and understand it.\n4.       Explain why the search for general principles that explain emergent phenomena make them an active locus of scientific investigation.\n5.       Discuss examples of emergent phenomena and explain why they are classified as emergent."

We also explore how courts interpret the content of employment agreements as well as what factors courts consider in awarding damages when an employment agreement is breached. Finally, we take a deeper dive into employment-related agreements such as non-disclosure agreements, non-disparagement agreements, and mandatory arbitration clauses, and how the law has evolved to keep up with the changing nature of the fundamental employment relationship."

It starts by talking about energy itself and where it comes from. This includes how much we have, who has it, who uses it, and what that all means. The video clips are produced in a fast-paced multimedia format during which Professor Ruzic throws in fun and demonstrations. There are multiple-choice questions to check your understanding and some more in-depth exercises to guide you deeper into the subject.\n\nAfter explaining the main things we use energy for – our cars and electronics! – fossil fuels are examined in detail. Want to really learn about fracking or pipelines? Watch these segments. The environmental effects of fossil fuels are taught as well. Global warming, acid rain, and geoengineering all are in this part of the course. Part of their solution is too. Renewables follow, with clips on solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels, etc. You’ll even see Professor Ruzic in a corn field and in the middle of a stream showing how you could dam it up.\n\nFinally, nuclear power is taught in detail – how it really works and what happens when it doesn’t work, as in Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, as well as how we are making it today, which is shown here without political preconceptions. In this course, economics takes center stage. People will ultimately do whatever costs the least, so energy policy is most effective when it is targeted at the user’s wallet.\n\nThroughout the course there are 24 segments on “How Things Work.\" These guides to everyday life are tremendously varied, covering everything from fireworks to making beer to what happens backstage at a theater. The course is designed to be enjoyable as well as informative. We hope you will take a look!"

More in detail, an Energy Manager is a person whose task is to manage what concerns energy within a company, a public body, or more generally a structure, verifying the energy consumption, optimising it, and promoting interventions aimed at energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources.In such respect, the course will provide the necessary information to:\n- verify consumption, through ad hoc audits or, if available, through digital models or reports produced by remote management;\n- optimise consumption through the correct regulation of systems and their appropriate use from an energy point of view;\n- promote energy-aware behaviour by employees and/or occupants of the facility;\n- propose improvement investments, possibly improving production processes or the performance of related services.\n\nThe course is structured into 4 Weeks.\nIn the first week a brief introduction about the course, highlighting the main skills of the energy manager, is provided. After that, the fundamental about energy in buildings is discussed in the second week. More in detail, the week aims to define the main energy, regulatory and market framework in which the energy manager has to deal with. Within the same week, the fundamentals of building physics and technical plants are also introduced. During week 3, the specific methodology to carry out the energy survey and audit as well as the available solution to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings are treated. In the last week, the general approach to face with specific digital tools are also shown and, finally, all the knowledge acquired over the weeks is applied in two exemplifying case studies."

En este curso, desarrollarás las estrategias necesarias para lograr que tus estudiantes aprendan no sólo conocimientos científicos conceptuales sino también aquellas herramientas que les permitan investigar el mundo que los rodea, de modo similar a como hacen los científicos y científicas.El curso es accesible tanto para aquellos que están dando sus primeros pasos en enseñanza de las ciencias como para quienes ya cuentan con experiencia o formación en el tema; no se necesita ningún laboratorio o material complejo. \n\nConversaremos acerca de la naturaleza de la ciencia, compartiremos estrategias para promover un rol activo de los estudiantes en la construcción del conocimiento, y trabajaremos la evaluación y la metacognición al servicio del aprendizaje. Al finalizar, habrás conocido los principales ejes de conversación contemporáneos acerca de la enseñanza de las ciencias naturales en el marco de las llamadas habilidades del siglo XXI, y desarrollado herramientas concretas para antes, durante y después de la clase.\n\nEste curso fue diseñado por la Fundación Bunge y Born en alianza con la Fundación Perez Companc, en el marco del Programa Sembrador."
