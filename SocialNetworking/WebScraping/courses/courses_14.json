En proposant pour la première fois une initiation en langue française, il s’agit de faire connaître l’apport des études genre aux sciences sociales et plus généralement de faire œuvre citoyenne, en sensibilisant les participant.e.s et les étudiant.e.s aux inégalités sociales entre les hommes et les femmes et aux formes de discriminations directes ou indirectes qui les concernent dans leur diversité. Le cours utilise différentes théories et matériaux empiriques et s’inscrit dans une perspective interdisciplinaire en mobilisant l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie et les sciences politiques. Il valorise une lecture transversale et approfondie de phénomènes contemporains complexes, telle que la question des différences et des identités sexuelles, celle des inégalités à l’échelle locale et globale et celle de l’intersection des rapports de pouvoir. En mobilisant les travaux consacrés à ce qu’on appelle « l’intersectionalité », c’est-à-dire la combinaison des divers clivages sociaux et rapports de pouvoir, il met en effet l’accent sur les processus qui participent de la fabrication des différences (qu’elles soient liées au genre, à la classe, à la “race”, à la sexualité, à la religion) et analyse leurs interconnexions. A l'aide d’exemples variés tirés de recherches disponibles en français et en anglais, de media, d’enquêtes ou d’archives, il cherche à comprendre et expliquer dans leurs contextes spécifiques, les multiples ressorts des logiques de genre qui structurent les sociétés contemporaines."

Sin embargo, pocos saben que la plaza de San Pedro en el Vaticano está construída sobre elipses donde sus focos se encuentran sobre las fuentes donde mucha gente se toma fotos. Estos son dos ejemplos que muestran la importancia de las figuras geométricas en nuestra vida.Después de este curso podrás reconocer fácilmente una línea recta, una parábola, una elipse, una circunferencia o una hipérbola a partir de una ecuación de segundo grado de dos variables. Además, sabrás manipular estas ecuaciones para escribirlas en su forma canónica y obtener así los elementos geométricos de cada curva. El punto de partida del curso es el concepto de función y sobre todo lo que representan los ceros (raíces) de una función de segundo grado de dos variables.\nUn curso de este tipo es fascinante, ya que mientras muchas personas ven símbolos matemáticos, tu podrás ver una figura geométrica al reconocer una ecuación. Es parecido a una película de ciencia ficción de los años noventa, donde se veía gente haciendo sus actividades diarias, pero no eran más que símbolos verdes sobre una pantalla obscura. Solamente los que podían descifrar estos símbolos eran capaces de ver la realidad. Seguramente este curso te permitirá ver al mundo de otra manera."

There is so much more to learn in Course 2 with 40 learning objectives spread out over 5 weeks and 12 lessons. We will cover all the ways we explore space and near space from planes to rockets to satellites and humans.Week 1 - We will hit the trail with two lessons on Aeronautics. \"Why is a aeronautics in a course about space?\" you might be asking yourself. Well aeronautics is used in many aspects of space exploration. It is also how we first started our exploration by getting off the ground. Part 1 connects us with Dr. Brian Argrow, who provides the context and background of aeronautics. Part 2 brings Dr. Gijs de Boer's perspective on the applications and connections with aeronautics and remote sensing. \n\nWeek 2 - This week will have three lessons that build upon last week's discussion on aeronautics. In Near Space, Dr. Tom Woods and I will explore the science that can be conducted in the Earth's atmosphere at the fringes of space. Mr. Dave Murrow and I will discuss Launch Vehicles and how everything we do in space is dependent on getting through near space and into space on a rocket. And finally, we will discover Orbits with Dr. Steve Nerem. Everything in the cosmos is in motion and that motion can be described by orbits. Getting to space is one thing. Getting around the solar system and beyond is all about orbits. \n\nWeek 3 - Spacecraft and satellites. So much of what we know about the cosmos was discovered by one of these two vehicles. While they may seem complicated, much of what goes into designing, building, testing, and flying a spacecraft is understandable by everyone. Spacecraft Systems is broken up into three parts. Part 1, we will discuss, the mission design process and systems engineering approach with three guests. David Ferguson, JB Young, and Dr. Nick Bradley. Part 2 will focus on the power, structures, and thermal subsystems as well as mission operations with our guests: Paul Anderson, Kamron Medina, Bruce Davis, Emily Brisnehan, and Kathy Schimmels. And finally Part 3, where we will explore the propulsion and computer subsystems and the methods for testing all the spacecraft systems with Dr. Jeff Ganley, Dr. Lee Jasper, Dr. Adam Pender, Jesse Austin, and Kyle Kemble. \n\nWeek 4 - This week (and next) we shift focus from space exploration with spacecraft to space exploration with humans. Astronauts have played a vital role in the exploration of the cosmos and have advantages over robotic mission in certain areas. Human Exploration is broken into four parts. In this week, we will cover parts 1 and 2. In Part 1, Dr. Allie Anderson sets the stage for what it takes to have a human in space. In Part 2, we will talk with Astronaut Jim Voss and discuss what it was like to be in space on his five trips there. \n\nWeek 5 - We will continue our lessons on Human Exploration from Week 4 with two more parts. Part 3 will be with Astronaut Joe Tanner and Part 4 will be Astronaut Rick Hieb. Both will add their perspectives to what it is like to be in space as a human and comment on where humanity should explore next. For those of you counting, that is three astronauts in one course. Pretty awesome huh? \n\nSo please consider enrolling in course 2 and together we will continue to pull back the curtain on the cosmos together making the unknown, known. Let's continue our journey together in finding your pathway to space."

By the end of this specialisation, our aim is that students will be able to critically apply epidemiological concepts to major global diseases and be able to appraise and recommend policy options to combat them.Global Diseases Masterclass: Global Disease Distribution\nIn this course, we will introduce students to the most important trends and pattern in health and disease on a global scale. We will look at how health has improved over time, examine the trends for the future and look at between and within-country inequality in health. We will look at the methods that lie behind those statistics and think about different ways in which health can be conceptualised and measured. The course ends by considering the reason that might lie behind the patterns that we’ve pointed out and introducing the distinction between direct and structural interventions.The course ends by considering the reasons that might lie behind the patterns that we’ve described and introducing the concept of structural interventions."

We’ve selected these diseases because they span a range of different types of disease and allow us to look at important issues that relevance of other diseases too. We will look at each disease in the same way: we begin by looking at the aetiology and epidemiology of the diseases. We then show how data on this disease can be used to understand important trends and patterns. We then focus on the interventions that can be used to address that disease - typically spanning both prevention and treatment - and consider how policies have been developed to address the disease. We finish by reflecting on the whole topic area of the disease with an external expert."

We have selected these non-communicable diseases because they span a range of different types of disease process and because of the expertise and experience that our School of Public Health has in these areas. This will provide an introduction to a few of the of most important global non-communicable disease challenges while also providing variation in aetiology, epidemiology and interventions to learn from. We hope that by the end of this course you will be able to describe the basics of the disease aetiology, global epidemic trends and the available interventions.

Concretely, you will learn how companies finance themselves using banks and capital markets and how Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance criteria are now deeply integrated in all financing processes.We will look at the role of syndication, and how it links issuers looking to raise capital to grow their businesses with investors looking to manage their assets and possibly liabilities. The role of banks in wider society will also be explored, from helping airlines to lease aircraft, to financing roads and bridges that help promote transport and trade, to funding renewable energy sources  such as wind or solar farms, right through to explaining the role of export finance, and the pivotal role exporting countries governments’ play, in promoting the movement of goods worldwide. \n\nWe will showcase the lifecycle of commodities, from exploration, to processing and refining, to how banks facilitate the global trade of products such as agriculture products or everyday items. We will also look at the exciting world of acquisition finance and leverage buy-outs, enabling strategic moves for industry players, as well as securitization, the repackaging of debt, and hedging, especially important as a mean to protect corporate companies against rate or price fluctuations.\n\nHaving a positive impact on society and the planet is clearly key for financial institutions. Throughout the whole course, we will illustrate with real cases the recent evolutions finance has gone through to incorporate ESG matters into its business decision making. \n\nThe collaboration between Societe Generale and EDHEC Business School builds on a long-standing partnership based on one common objective: to provide future talents with access to information and expertise that enables them to grow. \n\nThrough this MOOC, we are taking an innovative approach to learning by providing you with the theoretical basics of finance, thanks to the expertise of EDHEC as one of the world’s foremost business schools in Finance, and combining it with practical insights of business experts from Societe Generale, widely regarded as a global leader in Structured Finance, to show how the theory is put into practice."

Thinking globally helps explain new linkages between changes in the natural environment (demography, climate) and transformations of institutional designs. \nWill societies and peoples find a way to get along together in the long run despite intractable conflicts and divergence of social and national interests? Will States delegate enough sovereignty to universal organizations, breaking definitely with Hobbes’ constant (no transfer of power beyond national borders)? Will the World ever be governed, and more democratically governed? \nTo answer this series of central questions, global politics draws on anthropology, history, sociology, economics and psychology. A mix of paradigms comforts this mix of disciplines, since no single approach may suffice to explain global issues. Combining various ways of thinking is conducive to a fuller account of the myriads of transactions that make the planet evolve towards a more complex equilibrium."

Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs – what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs.While all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level. Progress towards establishing global management of human interactions with the climate system within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also discussed.\n\nThe course is designed and taught by Professor Katherine Richardson, who is a member of the 15-person panel appointed by the UN General Secretary in 2016 to write the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report. In each lecture, Katherine interviews experts who provide insights relevant to the topic at hand."

What are the risks of living in a world where “no one is in charge”? This course introduces students to systems thinking, network theory, and risk analysis and uses these tools to better understand the process of globalization. Focusing on trade, finance, and epidemiology, it analyzes potential challenges to the current global order.The course will be of interest to those studying global affairs, system dynamics, and world governance. It offers a set of heuristics that students can use to analyze contemporary global challenges. Linking the recording of Abbey Road to the COVID-19 pandemic provides new insights into the apparently chaotic world around us.\n\nComplex systems form the backbone of our increasingly interconnected and interdependent society. What were once more localized economies, supply chains, and social-ecological systems are now rapidly globalizing, and interacting with one another across countless spatial and temporal scales as technologies expand at ever greater velocities. These tightly coupled systems deliver greater efficiency and prosperity, but at the cost of greater fragility and the threat of catastrophic failure. This “global systemic risk” has implications in all functional domains affecting our daily lives—from the global financial system to healthcare, to critical infrastructure networks.\n\nOrganized with 7-10 minute classes grouped together into longer modules, the course will have a linear “core” curriculum presented at the introductory level, with the potential for optional offshoots that give learners a more in-depth look into certain areas with more technical content."

Together we’ll trace the emergence of design as a recognized practice, why things look the way they do, and how designers approached specific design problems in their work.Students will develop an understanding of where the wide variety of today’s design practice comes from. By participating in this survey of the works of innovative groups and individuals, we outline the process by which graphic design moved from a purely instrumental practice, to becoming a demanding creative and hybridized field.\n\nEach week, a short quiz will test your knowledge of concepts, and a short reflective assignment will give you the opportunity to analyze the questions designers ask themselves today.\n\nThis is an essential course for emerging designers entering the field, or for students interested in learning more about visual culture and analysis. No previous experience is required.\n\nA note about this course: \n\nThis course is taught from the perspective of contemporary design, to connect ideas that helped formulate design practice from the 1850s through the 1960s to the ways that designers think today. The relationship of words and pictures in graphic design is looked at through the ever-changing social and cultural contexts, technologies, aesthetics, and politics of their eras. \n\nThe definition and practice of graphic design includes all public visual communications, which is a global practice. It was the evolution of mass production and communication in the West that specifically redefined graphic design as a professional practice and is this course’s particular narrative. We hope students will consider how to connect the themes and ideas offered in this course to your own culture."

We will study Ramsey Theory which proves that in a large system, complete disorder is impossible! \n\nBy the end of the course, we will implement an algorithm which finds an optimal assignment of students to schools. This algorithm, developed by David Gale and Lloyd S. Shapley, was later recognized by the conferral of Nobel Prize in Economics.\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students."

    "content": "Renowned exercise physiologists Martin Gibala and Stuart Phillips of McMaster University teach the surprising new science of cardio fitness and strength-building—and then provide you with hacks to get fit and strong (and healthy!) in less time than you ever thought possible. What’s the right mix of exercise between cardio and strength? How do you know if you’re working out hard enough? What’s better, heavy or light weights? These questions and more are addressed through a course designed to provide even the most inexperienced of exercisers the tools you need to design time-efficient workouts that can be done virtually anywhere, from your own home to a city park or even at your workplace.Marty and Stu are good friends and colleagues who just happen to be two of the world’s most passionate scholars in the science of fitness. They aim to entertain you while they’re describing the relationship between exercise and health. Marty is a pioneer in the field of interval training, the technique of varying your workout intensity to get fit faster than anyone ever thought possible. Stu’s studies proved that lifting lighter weights can be a highly effective strength-building technique—plus he’s a leading expert in dietary protein and muscle. \n\nIn Hacking Exercise for Health, you’ll follow Marty and Stu as they teach you the basics about the way your body boosts its fitness and strength. Next, they’ll apply that theory, providing you with a series of do-anywhere workouts and, most importantly, teaching you what you need to know to design your own sessions. Filled with inspirational practical tips, fun quizzes, interactive community participation and assignments designed to help you remember your lessons, Hacking Exercise for Health will give you the tools and techniques to incorporate exercise into your life, no matter how busy you are."

    "content": "The aim of this course is to introduce learners to open-source R packages that can be used to perform clinical data reporting tasks. The main emphasis of the course will be the clinical data flow from raw data (both CRF and non-CRF) to SDTM to ADaM to final outputs. While several open-source tools to complete these tasks will be introduced, the objective of this course is not to become an expert in any of these tools but rather to introduce participants to the broader concepts behind these tasks. That way the tools simply serve as an example of how the underlying concepts could be put into action in code."
