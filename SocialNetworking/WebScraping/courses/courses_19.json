    "content": "Journey of the Universe weaves together the discoveries of the evolutionary sciences together with humanities such as history, philosophy, art, and religion.  The course draws on the Emmy-award winning film, Journey of the Universe, and the book from Yale University Press.Journey explores cosmic evolution as a creative process based on connection, interdependence, and emergence.  It examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.  \n\nThe Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and co-evolution. As we discover these intricate processes of evolution, we awaken to the beauty and complexity of our natural environment at this critical juncture in our planetary history.",

    "content": "More than ever, technology is shaping, and being shaped by, public policy. This has an enormous impact, particularly for marginalized communities. The artificial intelligence and computer algorithms increasingly driving government and industry decisions—from the allocation of social services to hiring—are reflecting and reinforcing social biases towards women, people of color, and disabled people, among others. Global climate change is having a disproportionately negative impact on low- and middle-income countries, and on historically disadvantaged communities of color in the United States. Communities are increasingly concerned they are not benefiting from government research funding, and that the regulation of emerging technologies is inadequate.The interconnectedness of technology, policy, and equality raises crucial questions for scientists, technologists, and leaders in public policy, civil society, and industry. How can technology be built, implemented, and governed more equitably? How can the concerns of marginalized communities be integrated better into technology and related policies? How should community knowledge and concerns be integrated with technical expertise and scientific evidence in the development of public policies?  \n\nThis course aims to help learners understand how inequity and injustice can become embedded in technology, science, and associated policies, and how this can be addressed.\n\nCombining real-world cases with scholarly insights, this course introduces learners to these challenges and offers tools for navigating them. You will learn about:\n- The landscape of technology policymaking\n- How technology, and related policies both reflect and reinforce social values, biases and politics\n- The power and limitations of technology in solving social problems \n- New ways to think about “experts” and “publics” \n- The politics of  innovation policy \n\nThe course is designed for people from diverse professional, advocacy, and academic backgrounds.

    "content": "*Broadening leadership competences to navigate economic, social and ecological challenges in wind energy transitions*This course is designed to help you develop your leadership competencies through experiential learning, reflection, and applying new approaches based on what you learn. It consists of 6 modules which present different themes in the renewable energy transition, particularly: justice in the energy transition (Module 2), participatory practices with local community members (Module 3), perspectives of other-than-humans (Module 4), alternative ownership and governance models (Module 5), and the management of wicked problems in transitions (Module 6). Additionally, each module provides exercises to help you apply the gained insights in your daily work as a leader in the wind energy sector.\n\nSteering towards a just and effective wind energy system demands strong leadership. While the idea of a strong leader is often associated with someone dominant, assertive, and focused on clear, immediate outcomes, the complexity and uncertainty involved in the wind energy transition require a different approach. As the EU works toward reaching its goal of 45 % renewable energy by 2030, accelerating wind energy presents a range of challenges. It is not just about what is technically and financially possible. Local authorities and developers involved in wind energy focus on economic, social, and environmental issues to transform the wind energy system towards greater justice and effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, these 6 modules place a strong emphasis on developing transition leadership competencies such as deep listening, reflecting on your assumptions, considering the perspectives of others, facilitating collective learning, and collaborating with different actors. Completing this course, you have broadened your leadership competencies to navigate the complex and uncertain realities of the renewable energy transition.",

Hemen her üniversite programında bir diferansiyel ve entegral hesap dersi var. Bu ders, çok önemli olmasına karşın, dünyada en az sevilen derslerden birisi de bu ders. Kimse dersin önemini inkâr etmiyor, ama ders hem öğrenci açısından hem de öğreticiler açısından sevimsiz bir deneyime dönüşüyor.\nBu dersin amacı: fonksiyonları tanıtmak. Niçin?\nMatematik bir dil. Sözel dillerde kelimeleri dilbilgisi kurallarıyla birleştirilerek gözlemleri ve düşünceleri oluşturuyoruz. Matematikte de benzer olarak, dilbilgisinin görevini birbiriyle çelişmeyen kabuller (aksiyomlar / postulatlar), kelimelerin görevini de işlemleri tanımlayan işaretler ve fonksiyonlar sağlıyor. Sözel dillerde en az binlerce kelime gerekirken, matematikte sadece onlarca “kelime” yani fonksiyon yeterli oluyor. Bu açıdan bakınca matematik sözel dillerden daha kolay olmalı...\nİşte bu nedenle, matematiğin kelimelerini, yani fonksiyonları tanımak çok önemli. Bu dersin amacı temel fonksiyonları tanıtmak. Bu fonksiyonları iyi bilmeyenler, matematik dilinde ilerlemekte, özel olarak da kalkülüste başarılı olamıyorlar.\n\nWhy this course: Precalculus?\nSingle variable functions are an introduction to calculus. Almost every university program has a course on differential and integral calculus. Although this course is very important, it is also one of the least popular courses in the world. No one denies the importance of the course, but it is not successful both for the students nor for the instructors. As a result, the lesson turns into an unpleasant experience for both the students and the instructors.\nThe aim of this course is to introduce functions. Why?\nMathematics is a language. In verbal languages, we combine words with grammatical rules to form observations and thoughts. In mathematics too, the task of grammar is to provide non-contradictory assumptions (axioms/postulates), and the task of words is provided by signs and functions that describe operations. While thousands of words are required in verbal languages, only dozens of \"words\" i. e. functions are sufficient in mathematics. From this point of view, mathematics should be easier than verbal languages.\nFor this reason, it is very important to recognize the functions that make up the words of mathematics. The aim of this course is to introduce the basic functions.",

That journey continues even today and we call it the Kennedy legacy.This course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how JFK’s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.\n\nUnderstanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.    \n    \nNovember 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy’s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy’s influence persist, and will it continue? What are the effects? \n\nWe’ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century. \n\nFollow on Twitter: @JFKclass.",

    "content": "It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity.The Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.\n\nIn this course created by former associate professor at the Søren Kierkegaard Research Centre, Jon Stewart, we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.",

This course will be an examination of the latter injunction in an effort to discover what self-knowledge is, why it might be valuable, and what, if any, limitations it might face. What is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her less wise, virtuous, or competent in certain areas than others who have this capacity, and what if anything might she do to fill that gap?  Historical sources as well as recent research in philosophy, experimental social psychology, and neuroscience will inform our investigation, in the course of which we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.Learning Outcomes: \nLearners will gain familiarity with prominent themes from Western, classical Chinese, and Buddhist approaches to our knowledge of ourselves. In the course of doing so, they will gain an appreciation of the relation of self-knowledge to wisdom, of the value of intellectual humility, as well as of methods of learning about oneself that do not depend on introspection. \n\nLearners will also become familiar with contemporary research in experimental social psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience into the emotions, the unconscious, the role of affect in decision making, and self-deception.

We will then learn about the revolutions in physics in the early 20th century that redefined our ideas of space and time, mass and energy. Finally, we will discuss how modern cosmology has shown us that we live in an ancient universe (14 billion years old), in one galaxy in a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies. At the end, will ask questions that don't necessarily have answers. What came before the Big Bang? Is there anything outside our universe? What is reality?

Social epistemology investigates the epistemic effects of social interactions: e.g., how we gain knowledge from social sources (others’ testimony, the media), how we should respond to disagreement, how groups (scientific teams, organisations) can know. It is among the most thriving areas in contemporary philosophy. Results in social epistemology have wide, direct impact on: (1) scientific practice (e.g. concerning academic publishing, guidelines for scientific authorship and collaboration, knowledge policy and debates over the role of the Internet in knowledge transmission and creation); (2) society at large (e.g. concerning voting, legal standards for criminal conviction, cross-cultural communication barriers, licensing mass communication policies, increasing social cohesion).​\nThis course is  therefore highly relevant in the​ context of a globalised society, replete with both easy-access information and misinformation, where it is more important than ever to know what separates trustworthy sources of information from untrustworthy ones.\n\nThis course is part of a KnowledgeLab project that has received funding from the  European Research Council (ERC)  Opens in a new tab\n \nKnowledgeLab is a major research project in social epistemology, financed by a Euro grant from the European Research Council and hosted by the  COGITO Epistemology Research Centre at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK.",

Korean Political Thought, however, while not entirely overlooked, remains relatively underexplored, and perhaps, underappreciated. But, we should remember that most Korean Confucians were not merely intellectuals. They aspired to put their ideas into action, trying to realize an ideal Confucian society. In that sense, they were also politicians, either with or without government participation. As such, they are often referred to as scholar-officials. It is, therefore, crucial to understand what their political visions were, how their ideas influenced Korean society, and what we can learn from them to make our world a better place. This lecture series, featuring eight thought-provoking sessions, offers a valuable introduction to Korean Political Thought.

    "content": "The Kotlin programming language is a modern language that gives you more power for your everyday tasks. Kotlin is concise, safe, pragmatic, and focused on interoperability with Java code. It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more. Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling support. It’s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers. Kotlin code might be compiled not only to JVM bytecode but to JavaScript and Native code as well, but this course is focused on Kotlin/JVM.This course aims to share with you the power and the beauty of Kotlin. We'll have a basic overview of the language, as well as a discussion of many corner cases, especially concerning Java interoperability. The course is based on your Java experience; it shows the similarities between the two languages and focuses on what's going to be different. \nNote that this course won't cover the programming fundamentals. We'll discuss: basic syntax, nullability, functional programming with Kotlin, object-oriented programming with Kotlin, the power of the Kotlin standard library, and Java interoperability.",

Para recorrer el camino hasta la “ética aplicada” es necesario partir de la noción de ética desde la perspectiva de la filosofía moral, haciendo énfasis en aquellos pensamientos que, desde la antigüedad, han marcado la pauta para su comprensión.De manera que este curso se centra en comprender algunos conceptos que dan origen a la ética y su aplicación en las diferentes profesiones de la vida humana y reflexionar sobre preguntas como: ¿Para qué sirve la ética? ¿Qué circunstancias de la evolución y del desarrollo humano dieron origen a la ética? ¿Es posible vivir en un mundo sin códigos morales? ¿Qué es la virtud? ¿Son los comportamientos éticos connaturales a los seres humanos o pueden ser adquiridos? ¿Cuál es el papel de los sentimientos en la ética? ¿Es el “deber”, prima face, el orientador de los comportamientos éticos?\n\nEl curso está estructurado en 5 semanas, en la semana 1 se enuncian las generalidades del curso. En la semana 2 se desarrolla el concepto de la ética, para qué sirve y su origen. En la semana 3 corresponde a la virtud, el carácter y las emociones. En la semana 4 se aborda el relativismo ético, los principios éticos universales a partir de la Declaración del parlamento de las religiones del mundo. La semana 5 se centra en la ética aplicada desde el campo de la vida profesional, la bioética, la ética médica, la ética y el medioambiente y, la ética empresarial.\n\nEl proceso de evaluación del curso se realiza a partir del estudio de un caso específico (de carácter sumativo) y un cuestionario de práctica (de carácter formativo) para cada semana que, por una parte, evidencian la apropiación de los temas tratados, y de otro lado, garantizan la obtención de la certificación del curso, puntualmente, con la aprobación de los casos sumativos que serán evaluados de forma colaborativa por medio de unos criterios específicos.\n\nEn cuanto a los contenidos del curso, en correspondencia con las políticas de accesibilidad y en coherencia con los diferentes estilos que propician los aprendizajes, están integrados a través del uso de formatos audiovisuales y esquemas gráficos. \n\nPor último, la metodología que se establece para el curso promueve un participante activo que no solo revisa de manera frecuente los contenidos, sino que además los apropia, los analiza y los aplica en el contexto de su vida profesional, producción académica, científica, investigativa y formativa.\n\n¿A quiénes van dirigidos los contenidos del curso? \nPersonas interesadas en adquirir conocimientos relacionados con la ética y su aplicación en la vida profesional.",

Nevertheless, they often are poorly understood by many, even including many who are engaged in the business of producing milk. The overall course goal is to introduce fundamental concepts that form the basis for understanding the biology of lactation, the biology of the mammary gland, and the products of that important physiological process.As a learner in this course, you will be provided with a series of easily understood presentations that collectively will help you build a foundation for greater understanding of lactation. You will be able to engage with other learners so that you can extend your learning beyond the video presentations. Ultimately, you will be able to construct your own mental model for understanding the wide range of topics that relate to the biology of lactation. Upon completion of the course, you will be prepared to expand your knowledge and understanding of lactation from other sources and experiences as you pursue your individual interests.\n\nBefore you start the course, I suggest that you identify a question or several questions about lactation that you already have on your mind. This could be from your own experiences, something you read about or saw, or something you have wondered about. Write down your question(s) and use that to help you decide how to engage with the content of this course. You might engage with the modules in the order they are presented, or start with a module that is of particular interest to you, or pick and choose modules in any order.

LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km² or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.Because LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining). This represents a new type of management, approached by shifting from single-sector based to multi-sector assessment and management, within the spatial domain of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.\n\nTogether, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues.

    "content": "*Broadening leadership competences to navigate economic, social and ecological challenges in wind energy transitions*This course is designed to help you develop your leadership competencies through experiential learning, reflection, and applying new approaches based on what you learn. It consists of 6 modules which present different themes in the renewable energy transition, particularly: justice in the energy transition (Module 2), participatory practices with local community members (Module 3), perspectives of other-than-humans (Module 4), alternative ownership and governance models (Module 5), and the management of wicked problems in transitions (Module 6). Additionally, each module provides exercises to help you apply the gained insights in your daily work as a leader in the wind energy sector.\n\nSteering towards a just and effective wind energy system demands strong leadership. While the idea of a strong leader is often associated with someone dominant, assertive, and focused on clear, immediate outcomes, the complexity and uncertainty involved in the wind energy transition require a different approach. As the EU works toward reaching its goal of 45 % renewable energy by 2030, accelerating wind energy presents a range of challenges. It is not just about what is technically and financially possible. Local authorities and developers involved in wind energy focus on economic, social, and environmental issues to transform the wind energy system towards greater justice and effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, these 6 modules place a strong emphasis on developing transition leadership competencies such as deep listening, reflecting on your assumptions, considering the perspectives of others, facilitating collective learning, and collaborating with different actors. Completing this course, you have broadened your leadership competencies to navigate the complex and uncertain realities of the renewable energy transition.",

The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics. Reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted. To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming—if done well—can be transformative for organizers and participants.Course Level Objectives:\nUnderstand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities. \nDescribe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment.\nCompare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education.\nAnalyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution. \nRecommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.",

    "content": "Regression Analysis is perhaps the single most important Business Statistics tool used in the industry. Regression is the engine behind a multitude of data analytics applications used for many forms of forecasting and prediction.This is the fourth course in the specialization, \"Business Statistics and Analysis\". The course  introduces you to the very important tool known as Linear Regression. You will learn to apply various procedures such as dummy variable regressions, transforming variables, and interaction effects. All these are introduced and explained using easy to understand examples in Microsoft Excel.\nThe focus of the course is on understanding and application, rather than detailed mathematical derivations.\nNote: This course uses the ‘Data Analysis’ tool box which is standard with the Windows version of Microsoft Excel. It is also standard with the 2016 or later Mac version of Excel. However, it is not standard with earlier versions of Excel for Mac. \n\n\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Regression Analysis: An Introduction\nIn this module you will get introduced to the Linear Regression Model. We will build a regression model and estimate it using Excel. We will use the estimated model to infer relationships between various variables and use the model to make predictions. The module also introduces the notion of errors, residuals and R-square in a regression model.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the Linear Regression\n•\tBuilding a Regression Model and estimating it using Excel\n•\tMaking inferences using the estimated model\n•\tUsing the Regression model to make predictions\n•\tErrors, Residuals and R-square\n \n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Regression Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Goodness of Fit\nThis module presents different hypothesis tests you could do using the Regression output. These tests are an important part of inference and the module introduces them using Excel based examples. The p-values are introduced along with goodness of fit measures R-square and the adjusted R-square. Towards the end of module we introduce the ‘Dummy variable regression’ which is used to incorporate categorical variables in a regression. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tHypothesis testing in a Linear Regression\n•\t‘Goodness of Fit’ measures (R-square, adjusted R-square)\n•\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n \n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Regression Analysis: Dummy Variables, Multicollinearity\nThis module continues with the application of Dummy variable Regression. You get to understand the interpretation of Regression output in the presence of categorical variables. Examples are worked out to re-inforce various concepts introduced. The module also explains what is Multicollinearity and how to deal with it. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n•\tInterpretation of coefficients and p-values in the presence of Dummy variables\n•\tMulticollinearity in Regression Models\n \n\nWEEK 4\nModule 4: Regression Analysis: Various Extensions\nThe module extends your understanding of the Linear Regression, introducing techniques such as mean-centering of variables and building confidence bounds for predictions using the Regression model. A powerful regression extension known as ‘Interaction variables’ is introduced and explained using examples. We also study the transformation of variables in a regression and in that context introduce the log-log and the semi-log regression models. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tMean centering of variables in a Regression model\n•\tBuilding confidence bounds for predictions using a Regression model\n•\tInteraction effects in a Regression\n•\tTransformation of variables\n•\tThe log-log and semi-log regression models",

    "content": "Ce cours explore les liens entre la littérature et la mondialisation. Il réhabilite, sous le nom de « littérature mondiale », une modernité esthétique méconnue qui a fait de la littérature un laboratoire critique des échanges culturels.Cette pensée littéraire de la mondialisation, inaugurée au XIXe siècle par Goethe, a été reprise, enrichie, transformée au fil des décennies dans l’ensemble des régions du monde. Elle traverse la littérature comparée et la traductologie depuis leurs débuts. Elle porte la plupart des œuvres contemporaines les plus décisives. Elle dessine un avenir possible des études littéraires.\n\nUne trentaine d’intervenant-es, dont près de vingt étudiant-es de l’Université de Genève, vous présentent de façon vivante les éléments principaux de cette histoire. Leur passion pour ce domaine de savoir s’adresse à quiconque cherche à mieux comprendre la place de la littérature dans la mondialisation. \n\nAu terme de ce parcours, la littérature n’aura plus pour vous les mêmes contours, ni les mêmes accents. Vous en sortirez avec un regard renouvelé sur ce que vous lisez habituellement, une meilleure connaissance des études littéraires en train de se faire et une idée plus claire de l’histoire de la mondialisation.",

    "content": "Learn about the impact of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production by understanding the science of growth, immunity, and infection and by learning the problem-solving skills needed to advance animal health and food production through optimal management practices.There is a growing global need in agricultural production for a workforce that is capable of integrating knowledge of animal health and production with an understanding of consumer preferences in the context of economic reality, business efficiency, and ethical constraint.  However, current evidence suggests that there is a growing shortage of people with the knowledge and problem-solving skills required to match the rapid advances being made in animal health, science, and food production.  The results of this shortage are wide-ranging and could lead to challenges in food security and agricultural economic competitiveness in some countries.\n\nIn this course we will explore the effect of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production. The content and learning outcomes of this new course will be designed to be relevant across different food production sectors (i.e., beef, dairy, poultry, and pigs). While the instructors will provide the participants with a strong scientific base for understanding the impact of infectious disease in animal-based food production, the emphasis of the material will be on practical problem-solving and will be directed towards equipping participants with a platform for developing the skills needed to contribute to sustainable food production.",

Animal disease in farmed livestock is important with regard to food safety, animal welfare, and in view of the economic importance of animal-source food production in many countries.Respiratory disease continues to be one of the greatest sources of loss, and hence lack of sustainability, to livestock production systems around the world. In this course, we will explore the factors that contribute to respiratory disease in livestock systems and practical tools to limit its impact on food system sustainability.  We will review the basics of respiratory physiology, immunology, and pathology along with how the commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms interact in food production ecosystems to prevent or promote respiratory disease.",
