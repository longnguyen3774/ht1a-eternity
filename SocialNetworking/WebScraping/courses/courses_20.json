    "content": "Welcome to this MOOC on Local Economic Development (LED). Local economic development refers to the processes by which local governments, businesses, and civil society groups get together to raise income sustainably and improve their lives in a well-defined area. It’s about creating jobs, securing livelihoods, improving infrastructure and managing local resources.What do I learn?\n\nWe will be dealing with questions such as the following. Why does economic development take place in some areas of the world and not in others? Why doesn’t it happen in your place? What prevents people from having the lives they want to live right there? Could your region make more of the opportunities of globalization and new technologies? Did the promises of decentralization in your country fail to deliver better public services and more responsive governments? If these are the questions you are asking yourself, this is the right course for you. It explores the where, who and how of economic development.\n\nPlease have a look at our list of contents for the coming 8 weeks:\n1.\tWhat is LED? What drives it?\n2.\tHow does globalization shape LED?\n3.\tHow does decentralisation affect LED?\n4.\tHow does competitiveness affect innovation?\n5.\tWhat are entrepreneurship and its dimensions?\n6.\tWhy are value chains and clusters so important?\n7.\tWhat are some LED strategies?\n8.\tYour project\n\nHow will I learn?\n\nIn each week you will be able to access the content of the videos, suggested readings and additional videos for selective deepening. You will also find assignments that you have to complete if you want to earn a certificate for this MOOC. We will first introduce our “toolkit”, a series of theories and concepts that will help you read the situation in your locality. We will explore the main factors affecting local economic development, such as globalization, decentralisation, and competitiveness. We will discuss key components, like entrepreneurship and innovation and look into the organization of local economies into clusters, value chains and learning regions. We will conclude by deepening on some specific constructs that make local economies grow to benefit their communities. You will also contribute your ideas in the discussion forums, where you will learn from other participants around the world. \n\nWhat makes this course special? \nThere is plenty of information in Internet on local economic development, which is mostly prepared by international donors or multilateral organisations. So what does this course do differently? First of all, the course is offered by academics that have significant published research on local economic development. This course gathers a wealth of academic knowledge that often fights the assumptions on what things are supposed to be like. Second, the instructors of this course have participated in dozens of capacity building projects in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Putting learning at the centre, they worked with communities, local governments, international donors and business associations. They often found a significant distance between theory and practice in local economic development, and this has been the basis of learning. Third, the course is acutely aware that each region is different and does not attempt to offer a one-size-fits-all recipe. It singles out key factors that drive local economic development and enables participants to do their own learning process, defining local problems and appropriate solutions. The aim of the course is that participants come up with their own ideas on how to promote local economic development.\n\nHow will I get a certificate?\n\nIf you want a certificate for participating in this MOOC, you will need to complete a small assignment each week and participate in the discussion forums. In the end of the MOOC, you will put these contributions together in one final document, your Capstone Project. \n\nI hope you find this course exciting and that you get to share our passion for promoting local economic development. \n\nYour instructors\nDr. Georgina M. Gómez, ISS\nProf. Emeritus AHJ (Bert) Helmsing, ISS\nDr. Jan Fransen, IHS"

Like the others in the series, this is a hands-on course, giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life, messy data, with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally, the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesn’t just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said, much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set, so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: \nExplain when it is valid to use logistic regression \nDefine odds and odds ratios \nRun simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in R and interpret the output \nEvaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in R \nDescribe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model \n\nThis course builds on skills such as hypothesis testing, p values, and how to use R, which are covered in the first two courses of the Statistics for Public Health specialisation.

Luther is recognized today as the originator of many of the most significant ideas that continue to affect and shape who we as modern people are and how we see the world and ourselves for better and for worse.In the first section, we will explore why Luther thought the Bible was the most important volume for everyone to have and read. Included here will be a careful consideration of Luther's anti-Judaism, which contributed to western antisemitism and some of the greatest horrors of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the second section, we will talk about the idea of freedom and how Luther's understanding of freedom in Christ affected the way modern thinkers understood what it means to be human in community. Important in this section is the consequential contradiction between freedom and slavery in western thought and their co-existence in western societies.\n\nThe third section will be all about the many complicated relations between religion and politics.\n\nNOTE:  Students wishing to sign up for free access to all instructional course content should click on the \"Sign-In\" button in the upper right hand corner.

In addition , the development of the Fundamental Relation and its various transformations leads to a clear path to property relations and to the concept of ensembles needed to understand the relationship between atomic and molecular structural properties and macroscopic properties.  We then explore the relationship between atomic and molecular structure and macroscopic properties by taking a statistical point of view. Using a postulatory approach, the method for doing this is made clear. This leads to the development of the partition function which describes the distribution of molecular quantum states as a function of the independent, macroscopic thermodynamic properties."

The course should act as ideal preparation for those interested in undertaking an undergraduate degree in Architecture, although its flexible, intriguing and enjoyable content makes it accessible for all those looking to increase their knowledge in the field.Delivered primarily by Professors from the IE School of Architecture and design in Segovia (Spain), the course begins by examining the mind-set of an Architect - asking how they think and what they do to train their creative minds, moving on to using inspiration from the environment to stimulate design ideas.  Finally, the course concludes by looking at some of the more technical aspects of Architecture - such as composition, form, space and hierarchy - and stressing the importance of creating a story that helps define your design.\n\nThis fascinating content is delivered principally from the stunning design studio at the IE school of Architecture and features external videos from a few beautiful locations in the city of Segovia.  Finally, it includes interviews from Pritzker Prize executive director - and Dean of the school of Architecture and design at IE - Martha Thorne, with a number of award winning practising architects such as Sarah Wigglesworth and Cristoph Ingenhoven."

Globally, communities are already experiencing the consequences of the crisis in various ways: from increases in extreme weather and changes to ecosystems to rising sea levels and depleting natural resources.Despite the clear consequences of climate change, political action has so far proven inadequate at addressing the crisis. Democratic countries are no exception in this regard, which raises questions about the democratic system's ability to deliver the policies and actions needed to address climate change. \n\nThe goal of this course is to zoom in on the relationship between democracy and climate change action. Do democratic systems have the capacity to deal with a threat like the climate crisis? If so, what will this require in terms of innovating democracy as a political system?\n\nDuring the course, you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen who specialise in various areas relevant to this course. This includes scholars working on political and democratic theory, climate and environmental science, authoritarianism, international politics, and non-state actors. Furthermore, you will be presented with interviews from real-world actors who have engaged in the climate debate in various ways.\n\nWe hope you will join this course to equip yourself with the knowledge needed to take part in the ongoing discussions related to climate change and the role of democracies in addressing its many challenges."

This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are—in your city, community, or neighborhood—and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans—our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. \n\nThis Teach-Out will ask the following questions:\n•\tWhat are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? \n•\tHow do people connect with places in our modern cities? \n•\tDo places progress? \n•\tHow can we measure in them whether there is any “progress”? \n\nWe will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.\n\nA Teach-Out is: \n– an event – it takes place over a fixed, short period of time \n– an opportunity – it is open for free participation to everyone around the world \n– a community – it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals \n– a conversation – an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people \n\nThis community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory’s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. \n\nOriginating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community.

Disruptions can include leaked private information, unauthorized access to information or systems, blocked user access, interference with security and privacy, or numerous other variations of attacking systems.Malware analysis dissects malware to gather information about the malware functionality, how the system was compromised so that you can defend against future attacks. \n\nAssembly is a low-level language that is used to communicate with the machine. Assembly programming is writing human-readable machine codes or machine instructions that are directly read by the computer. All high-level languages compiled programs like C or C++ can be broken down, analyzed, and understood using Assembly language with the help of a debugger. This process is known as reverse engineering.  Understanding what an executable program does is easy if you have direct access to the source code. But if not, such as the case with malware, learning Assembly can be helpful.\n\nIn this course, through video demonstrations, hands-on reverse engineering, and capture-the-flag type activities, you will be introduced to the processes and methods for conducting malware analysis of different file types. You will analyze native executable files, and analyze popular files like PowerShell, JavaScripts, and Microsoft Office documents.\n\nThen you will learn the fundamentals of Assembly language, basic Win32 Assembly programming concepts, and how Reverse Engineers use Assembly to analyze malware."

The presence of COVID and political issues related to instances of over-policing have increased these stresses even more.  This course has two goals.  First, we want to inform officers how their stress system works and why they sometimes feel as they do.  With this as a foundation we then describe some strategies officers can use to manage this system, giving themselves much needed breaks from the stress response and overall empowering them with a greater sense of control over how their bodies react to stress."

Esta reputación, bastante inmerecida, obedece al poco conocimiento que se tiene sobre ella y sobre sus enormes posibilidades de aplicación en el mundo científico, en diferentes campos de la industria y la producción, así como en la vida cotidiana. Así, si se observa con atención el mundo, es posible identificar un sinnúmero de aplicaciones de la química, que hacen la vida más cómoda: éstas van por ejemplo desde la producción de alimentos y la generación de nuevos medicamentos, hasta la producción de nuevos materiales, de gran importancia para misiones espaciales.En este curso, distribuido en 5 módulos, se pretende aproximar al estudiante al maravilloso mundo de la Química. Cada módulo está orientado a trabajar con fundamentos o conceptos básicos de la Química, a través de cuyo estudio se posibilita su mejor comprensión y manejo. Así, el primer módulo versa sobre las medidas y cifras significativas; con él, se aprenderá acerca de la importancia de la medición en la labor del químico. En el segundo módulo se aborda el tema de los factores de conversión, necesarios para los procesos llevados a cabo en el laboratorio. En el tercero, es posible conocer la tabla periódica, su nomenclatura y sus elementos.  El cuarto módulo se centra en el trabajo alrededor del concepto de mol y en fórmulas químicas, útiles para comprender las relaciones estequiométricas. Por último, en el quinto módulo se trabaja el tema de las reacciones químicas y la estequiometría, fundamentales para el trabajo no solo del químico, sino del biólogo, el farmaceuta y el ingeniero de alimentos. \nEste curso sirve como base para otros cursos de química, ya que, con soporte en él, se busca contribuir a resolver problemáticas que presentan muchos estudiantes cuando inician el aprendizaje de la química, a nivel universitario o de bachillerato. Cada en módulo puede encontrar lecturas, multimedias y videos. Al final de cada módulo hay una evaluación de tipo test sobre los conceptos tratados; igualmente, a partir de cada vídeo se dejan unas tareas opcionales, orientadas a trascender lo trabajado en este. Para superar el curso se pueden usar 5 semanas, con una dedicación estimada de 14 horas en total."

Why adding just a small amount of carbon to iron results in an alloy that is so much stronger than the base metal?  In this course, you will learn how a material’s properties are determined by the microstructure of the material, which is in turn determined by composition and the processing that the material has undergone.This is the second of three Coursera courses that mirror the Introduction to Materials Science class that is taken by most engineering undergrads at Georgia Tech.  The aim of the course is to help students better understand the engineering materials that are used in the world around them.  This first section covers the fundamentals of materials science including atomic structure and bonding, crystal structure, atomic and microscopic defects, and noncrystalline materials such as glasses, rubbers, and polymers."

Real-world data often require more sophisticated models to reach realistic conclusions. This course aims to expand our “Bayesian toolbox” with more general models, and computational techniques to fit them. In particular, we will introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which allow sampling from posterior distributions that have no analytical solution. We will use the open-source, freely available software R (some experience is assumed, e.g., completing the previous course in R) and JAGS (no experience required). We will learn how to construct, fit, assess, and compare Bayesian statistical models to answer scientific questions involving continuous, binary, and count data. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development, explanations of the statistical modeling process, and a few basic modeling techniques commonly used by statisticians. Computer demonstrations provide concrete, practical walkthroughs. Completion of this course will give you access to a wide range of Bayesian analytical tools, customizable to your data."

The purpose of this course is to give you a better understanding of different measures of impact that could be used in the evaluation of a program in the areas of maternal and child health and nutrition.  For each of the measures presented, we will discuss current sources of data you might draw on as well as describe the methods that can be used to measure these. When we describe the methods, we also try to identify the strengths and weakness of the methods as well as their suitably for use in an evaluation. The course also discusses how modeling can be used in evaluations as either a replacement for measuring impact or to supplement measured impact. The last two lessons in this course focus on giving you an introduction and training on how the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) works and how to use it. This model can be used to estimate most – if not all – of the impact measures we describe in the course and can be an important part of both planning and estimating impact in an evaluation of a large-scale program.  While this course is self-contained, it is also linked to other courses on evaluation. We developed this course for public health program managers and evaluators and assume the students in the course will have a background in public health with a focus on maternal and child health in low- and middle-income countries.The development of this course was supported by a grant from Government Affairs Canada (GAC) for the Real Accountability, Data Analysis for Results (RADAR) project."

These facts may seem obvious today, but it took decades of epidemiological research to produce the necessary evidence. In this course, you will learn the fundamental tools of epidemiology which are essential to conduct such studies, starting with the measures used to describe the frequency of a disease or health-related condition. You will also learn how to quantify the strength of an association and discuss the distinction between association and causation. In the second half of the course, you will use this knowledge to describe different strategies for prevention, identify strengths and weaknesses of diagnostic tests and consider when a screening programme is appropriate."

You will also understand how paleoanthropologists look for musculoskeletal adaptations in fossils to reconstruct how something in the past moved. You’ll explore how musculoskeletal adaptations correlate with bipedalism, as well as what significance these clues hold for telling us about how hominins moved. Additionally, you will learn the kinematics of other habitual striding bipeds found in the animal kingdom.Every module of this course has been created with the intention of a “hands-on” learner experience, where you can play around with and learn from 3D renditions of different human and animal fossils. Through these exercises, you will be able to observe and describe animal behavior in order to explain the function of their locomotion and how that relates to our own."

    "content": "課程介紹與教學目標 (About the course)房屋為我們遮風避雨，讓我們安心工作、生活，而結構系統又是房屋的骨幹，讓房屋能站的又高、又直、又穩。你知道橫者為梁，直者為柱，但你知道在結構工程師的眼中，梁與柱有什麼其他的不同嗎？他們其中藏著什麼秘密，能支撐起整個結構？工程師要怎麼決定梁該有多深？柱該有多粗？該用矩形、圓形還是其他形狀？該用實心還是空心？在有地震的地方，設計上是否又有不一樣的考量？\n　　材料力學是通往上述問題解答關鍵的一步。在材料力學(一)裡，我們會由大家熟知的虎克定律開始，以蓋房子的重要材料「結構鋼」為例，深入探討「力量」與「變形」這兩個令結構工程師愛恨交加的物理量之間的關係。然後依序探討結構桿件受軸力（拉/壓）、受扭、受彎、受剪四大外力作用下，會在桿件內部產生怎樣的相對應變形與受力，並探討建築結構設計概念與提供桿件設計演算範例。\n　　本課程是希望精通「鋼筋混凝土設計」、「鋼結構設計」、「木構造設計」者必備的先修課程，也為對「彈性力學」有興趣者，提供許多基礎知識與這些知識如何實際應用於工程設計。\n主要授課對象為土木、建築相關從業人員與在學學生，其他包括工學院各科系同學或對材料力學有興趣的人士，也歡迎選修。\n\n授課形式 (Course format)\n　　本堂課將以影片的形式為主, 搭配課後作業及期末報告的形式來進行。\n\n修課背景要求 (Recommended background)\n　　靜力學 ( Statics )"
