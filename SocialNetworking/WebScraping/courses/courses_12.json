An updated version of the course will launch in late Fall 2025, with revised lessons, examples, and explanations that align with the new law.\nIn the meantime, please note that some content may reflect pre-2025 rules.\n\nThis course is the first course in a five-course US Federal Tax Specialization. It covers and focuses on the U.S. federal tax system as it relates to individuals, employees, and sole proprietors. Key concepts covered include gross income and items that are statutorily included or excluded in it, personal and business expenses that qualify as tax deductions, and the differing tax treatments for employees versus self-employed taxpayers. Unlike many other introductory courses in tax and as part of this course’s comprehensive wrap-up, learners will be provided with practical and tangible experience reporting both income and expenses on the main individual tax return used in the US, Form 1040.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this course, consider enrolling in our online graduate Accounting program.

Each of the major food animal species (dairy, swine, beef, and poultry) will be covered in terms of their universal life cycles, constraints to production and emerging societal issues.Throughout the course, we will tackle some difficult and important questions:\nWhat are the major health benefits and potential concerns regarding the production and consumption of animal products?\nHow does animal production affect the efficient use of resources and impact our environment?\nCan cost of production be reduced to meet growing demand for animal products around the globe while maintaining health and safety for both animals and consumers?\nWhat are the different types of animal food production systems?\n\nMyths and misconceptions surrounding the animal food systems will be discussed. We’ll also look closely at some of the global issues, problems, and challenges in these food systems which scientists, farmers, and veterinarians, are attempting to solve through collaboration.\n\nLectures will be delivered by several experts from the University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine who are intimately involved in the study and advancement of animal production systems. The course is geared towards learners who seek a greater understanding of animal food systems as well as those who might have never visited an animal farm, but have a desire to learn more about where some of our food comes from and issues surrounding sustainability."

The goal here is give you a roadmap and framework for how financial professional make decisions.We will cover the basics of financial valuation, the time value of money, compounding returns, and discounting the future.  You will understand discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation and how it compares to other methods.  We also step inside the mind of a corporate financial manager and develop the basic tools of capital budgeting.  We will survey the how, when, and where to spend money, make tradeoffs about investment, growth, dividends, and how to ensure sound fiscal discipline.  Our journey then turns to a Wall Street or capital markets perspective of investments as we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between risk and return.  We then synthesize our discussion of risk with our valuation framework and incorporate it into series of direct applications to practice.\n\nThis course requires no prior familiarity with finance.  Rather, it is intended to be a first step for anyone who is curious about understanding stock markets, valuation, or corporate finance.  We will walk through all of the tools and quantitative analysis together and develop a guide for understanding the seemingly complex decisions that finance professionals make.  \n\nBy the end of the course, you will develop an understanding of the major conceptual levers that push and pull on financial decision making and how they relate to other areas of business.  The course should also serve as a roadmap for where to further your finance education and it would be an excellent introduction of any students contemplating an MBA or Finance concentration, but who has little background in the area."

Participants will learn how to analyze historical data, calculate key financial drivers, and forecast segment-wise revenues, expenses, and cash flows. The course guides learners through constructing income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, progressing into evaluating capital expenditures, depreciation schedules, and working capital cycles.As the course advances, learners will compute valuation metrics such as Net Present Value (NPV), Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF), and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), culminating in the creation of a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. They will then apply relative valuation techniques, including EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples, to compare peer companies, and interpret share prices under multiple forecast scenarios.\n\nThis course not only builds technical modeling expertise using Excel, but also strengthens the learner’s ability to evaluate financial performance, interpret valuation outputs, and apply strategic thinking to real business contexts. By the end, learners will be able to confidently design, construct, and assess comprehensive valuation models used in investment banking, equity research, and corporate finance."

However, almost 70% of world’s urban population is living in the cities where governments are struggling to provide basic services like sanitation, schools, hospitals, and adequate clean water.The reason is that, their governments do not have enough money. This may also be true also for the city where you live or work. Poor infrastructure affects your daily life. Local governments struggle with mobilizing finances so that they can improve your quality of life but many times they are not aware of the right mechanisms. \n\nImagine that your government wants to know how can they finance cities and they want you to advise – where will you begin with? Our finance experts are bringing their experience right at your Desk through this MOOC. This MOOC has five modules and in five weeks you will learn:\n•\tFinancial decision making environment in urban systems\n•\tMechanisms for mobilizing local revenues\n•\tInnovative mechanisms for financing infrastructure projects through partnerships, and \n•\tFinancial decision making under uncertainties and risks\n\nWe will provide you a carefully selected set of literature, quizzes and interactive discussion forums.

The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an\nintroductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is\nnatural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not\nformal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a\ncompetent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional\nanalysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the\nmethods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite\nElement Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical\nfoundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner\npresented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,\nalthough the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.\n\nThe development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):\nelliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to\nthe physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in\none dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We\nthen move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and\nmass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems\nin vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next\n(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in\nthree dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to\nquestions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who\nfollowed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical\ndevelopment to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.\n\nBooks:\nThere are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required\ntextbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader\ntreatments than can be provided in any form of class:\n\nThe Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.\nHughes, Dover Publications, 2000.\n\nThe Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals, O.C. Zienkiewicz, R.L. Taylor and\nJ.Z. Zhu, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2005.\n\nA First Course in Finite Elements, J. Fish and T. Belytschko, Wiley, 2007.\n\nResources:\nYou can download the deal.ii library at dealii.org. The lectures include coding tutorials where\nwe list other resources that you can use if you are unable to install deal.ii on your own\ncomputer. You will need cmake to run deal.ii. It is available at cmake.org."

In this course healthcare providers, administrators, engineers, and healthcare professional students will be taught how to apply the principles and tools of Lean to health care. They will learn how to identify and remove of waste, design standardized work, apply 5S, map Value streams, create process maps, conduct rapid improvement events (RIEs), level workflow, use A3 forms and Paredo charts, apply error proofing, and create effective visual controls. The instructional videos minimize Lean technical language, and include patient cases to make the lessons more appealing to students in healthcare. Acknowledging that patients are very different from cars we have carefully adapted Lean to health care and call our system: Patient-centered Healthcare Delivery System (PHDS). The name and abbreviation emphasize two key principles taught in our course: 1. Just like PhDs the scientific method must be continually applied when creating plans to improve our systems of care. 2. All improvements must be made looking through the eyes of patients. Armed with this new knowledge students will be able to design and implement sustainable healthcare delivery system improvements."

To address these public health crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead, towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those that threaten it. In addition, we will present a compelling rationale for a return to simple home cooking, an integral part of our efforts to live longer, healthier lives.View the trailer for the course here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7x1aaZ03xU"

Este curso desarrolla y fortalece sus capacidades para formar, en la escuela, a ciudadanos que actúen de manera constructiva en una sociedad democrática, particularmente en tres ámbitos de la ciudadanía: la convivencia pacífica, la participación democrática y la valoración de las diferencias.Si está interesado en aportar a la construcción de una sociedad pacífica, democrática e incluyente a través de la educación, este es el lugar donde puede aprender herramientas pedagógicas primordiales para cumplir esa misión. Si bien el curso presenta ideas que pueden ser útiles para actores educativos en general, los ejemplos y estrategias están particularmente dirigidos a docentes de contextos escolares.\n\nTeniendo en cuenta que formar para el ejercicio activo, crítico y constructivo de la ciudadanía es una necesidad prioritaria en los contextos actuales, el curso presenta los temas, asuntos, problemas y conceptos indispensables para promover el desarrollo de competencias ciudadanas de niños, niñas y jóvenes en formación. Para lograrlo se propone analizar la ciudadanía a través de la ampliación progresiva de sus contextos de aplicación: el individual, el interpersonal, el grupal, el comunitario y el mundial.\n\nAdicionalmente a estas comprensiones conceptuales, el curso ofrece la oportunidad de desarrollar capacidades didácticas en los participantes, quienes podrán diseñar estrategias pedagógicas orientadas al desarrollo de las competencias ciudadanas de sus educandos y a la construcción de ambientes democráticos de aprendizaje que favorezcan dicho desarrollo.\n\nLas actividades propuestas en el curso están diseñadas de tal forma que los participantes puedan apropiarse de herramientas conceptuales y pedagógicas a partir del principio de “aprender haciendo”, en donde permanentemente estarán poniendo en práctica dichos aprendizajes. Este es un curso ampliamente flexible que permite a los participantes escoger diferentes rutas de aprendizaje para concentrarse en los contenidos de su interés y/o en el nivel de profundización que quieren alcanzar para cada uno de ellos. Es así como el curso permitirá, especialmente a docentes escolares, desarrollar y fortalecer las capacidades que les permitan educar para la ciudadanía, formando ciudadanos activos y críticos, que respeten la diferencia, que conozcan y hagan uso de los mecanismos de participación para la transformación de sus comunidades y que resuelvan pacífica y constructivamente los conflictos y retos que les plantea la sociedad en su rol como ciudadanos de su vida, de su comunidad y del mundo.\n\nEl diseño de este curso fue realizado en el marco de la segunda fase del SREDECC (Sistema Regional de Evaluación y Desarrollo de Competencias Ciudadanas), un escenario latinoamericano de cooperación técnica, financiado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y operado por la Fundación Antonio Restrepo Barco.

In this first week of this course you will learn the basic logic of how firms and markets function by using economic logic from a distinctly strategic perspective.The economic logics discussed in the first week have shaped the field of strategic analysis from very early on. Porter’s Five Forces – probably the most well-known strategic analysis tool – directly builds on the notion of market structures and helps us to get a deeper understand of how the competitive environment affects the ability of firms to generate true economic profits. In this week, we´ll look at how Porter's Five Forces are related to market structures, economies of scale, and begin to touch on how firms leverage these to create competitive advantage.\n\nWeek three, we will move away from exclusively considering  the external structure of an industry as the source of competitive advantage and instead focus our view on the internal resources and capabilities within firms – and the associated “resource based view” to look at how internal resources and capabilities play out in competitive situations.\n\nLooking through the lens of the five forces at the industry, or through that of the resource-based view at firm internal resources and capabilities, feels a bit like swings of a pendulum – and, indeed, strategic theory and practice over the last decades has veered from a near-exclusive focus on the environment to being entranced by firms’ core capabilities. However, to get the full picture of where your firm stands (and where it and its industry may move) requires us to consider both of these perspectives! In this final week we will work on this crucial integration by building our understanding of what a competitive advantage truly is – and what distinct forms it can take."

This knowledge serves as the cornerstone for designing effective behavior support plans. The second lesson, Antecedent Intervention, introduces proactive strategies to prevent challenging behaviors before they occur. These include modifying environments, routines, or instructions to reduce triggers and promote appropriate alternatives. The third lesson, Consequence-Level Intervention, teaches students how to respond to behaviors after they happen in ways that reduce problem behavior and encourage positive change. This includes reinforcement strategies, redirection, and planned responses.\n\nThroughout the course, participants will develop their ability to observe, assess and intervene based on the function of behavior.\n\nIMPORTANT: This course is not designed to prepare students for national certification, such as the Registered Behavior Technician credential offered by the BACB. Enrollees will gain the foundational/fundamental knowledge on subject matter relevant to the profession. While references may be made throughout the training to Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) or Behavior Technicians (BTs), to gain industry certification, a more comprehensive program must be completed through enrollment via approved/eligible schools such as MedCerts."
