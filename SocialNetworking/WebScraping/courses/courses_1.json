In today’s world, the internet connects nearly everyone and everything, and this is accomplished through networking. While most see computer networking as a positive, criminals routinely use the internet, and the networking protocols themselves, as weapons and tools to exploit vulnerabilities and for this reason we must do our best to secure the network. We will review the basic components of a network, threats and attacks to the network, and learn how to protect them from attackers. Network security itself can be a specialty career within cybersecurity; however, all information security professionals need to understand how networks operate and are exploited to better secure them. \n\nAfter completing this chapter, the participant will be able to: \n\nExplain the concepts of network security. \n\n- Recognize common networking terms and models. \n- Identify common protocols and ports and their secure counterparts. \n- Identify types of network (cyber) threats and attacks. \n- Discuss common tools used to identify and prevent threats. \n- Identify common data center terminology. \n- Recognize common cloud service terminology. \n- Identify secure network design terminology. \n- Practice the terminology of and review network security concepts. \n\nAgenda\n\nCourse Introduction\nModule 1: Network Concepts and Models \nModule 2: Common Network Threats and Attacks\nModule 3: Network Security Infrastructure\nModule 4: Network Security Review\n\nThis training is for IT professionals, career changers, college students, recent college graduates, advanced high school students and recent high school graduates looking to start their path toward cybersecurity leadership by taking the Certified in Cybersecurity entry-level exam.\n\nThere are no prerequisites to take the training or the exam.

It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University’s MOOCs. \n\nAddressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",

For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels – coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important – and sometimes conflicting – drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earth’s environments. \n\nIn this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (“realities”) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.",

Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.In this Ableton Certified Training Center course developed by Berklee Online, you will explore some of Live’s most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not own Ableton Live 10, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial.

Sabemos que gran parte de los problemas de salud mental de la vida adulta se inician en la adolescencia y juventud. Por otra parte, se ha demostrado en diversos estudios internacionales que ha aumentado la prevalencia de problemas de salud mental en adolescentes y jóvenes respecto a los datos registrados antes de la pandemia. Dada la relevancia de esta temática, es que se ha diseñado este curso introductorio sobre abordaje del riesgo suicida en adolescentes y jóvenes.El curso está dirigido a población adulta que esté en contacto estrecho con adolescentes y jóvenes como: personas encargadas de grupos de jóvenes (ej. grupos deportivos, scouts, etc.), profesionales de la salud, docentes, familias, entre otras y que tenga interés en adquirir herramientas, desarrollar habilidades e implementar estrategias para un abordaje oportuno y adecuado del riesgo suicida en esta población. Con el mismo propósito, también este curso está dirigido a quienes en el futuro ejercerán un rol profesional con jóvenes (ej. estudiantes de carreras de la salud, de psicología, de trabajo social, de educación, etc.), a quienes ejercen el rol o ejercerán un rol en la comunicación sobre suicidio (ej. periodistas, estudiantes de periodismo), y a personal de primera línea en la atención de personas afectadas por esta temática, (ej. policías, bomberos/as, rescatistas, gendarmes, etc.). \n\nAl final del curso esperamos que puedas: \n\n• Reconocer la relevancia de abordar el riesgo suicida en adolescentes y jóvenes y el rol que tenemos todos y todas en su prevención considerando directrices de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, el cuestionamiento a los mitos y creencias erróneas, y el uso de una comunicación segura y responsable con el fin de favorecer un entorno protector.\n• Reconocer los factores asociados al riesgo suicida en adolescentes y jóvenes y aplicar herramientas para la detección y evaluación de su gravedad con el propósito de favorecer el acceso a los apoyos que se requieren.\n• Describir conductas y procedimientos iniciales a seguir frente a adolescentes y jóvenes con riesgo suicida para disminuir dicho riesgo de manera oportuna. \n• Describir el actuar más adecuado en el caso de una muerte por suicidio de una persona adolescente o joven, de manera de apoyar a las personas cercanas que han sufrido la pérdida, promover la recuperación saludable de la comunidad afectada y reducir el riesgo de comportamiento suicida imitativo. \n\n\nAlerta: Si usted tiene interés en esta temática porque conoce a una persona que presenta un potencial riesgo suicida, porque ha perdido a una persona cercana por suicidio o porque usted está con pensamientos de suicidio, le advertimos que el contenido del curso puede ser sensible y que éste, en ningún caso, reemplaza la atención de profesionales de la salud.

After developing a broad understanding of accounting and financial statements, you will begin to develop a more nuanced understanding of individual components of doing business, such as making a sale or building inventory.  By considering many of the more common actions of a company, you will build your understanding of accounting, and explore these concepts by applying them across various types of transactions. Once you understand these individual concepts better, you will be ready to return to the overall financial statements and use them as informational tools, including building ratios.You can do this course standalone or to qualify for the residential component of the Finance for Strategic Decision-Making Executive Education program.

    "content": "Sports have become an ever-present reflection of American culture, and an important symbol of the divisions and alliances in our society. Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports.How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space — or doesn't — for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they \"shut up and dribble\"? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. \n\nYour professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today.",

    "content": "Acute stroke is a time-dependent medical emergency. In acute ischemic stroke, the first objective is to restore brain flow using sistemic thrombolytic treatment and, in patients with large vessel occlusion, by endovascular treatment. In hemorrhagic stroke there are also specific treatments that can improve the clinical outcome.The sooner the initiation of all these therapies the higher the clinical benefit. Thus,  the organization of Stroke Code systems coordinated between emergency medical systems and hospitals is crucial to achieve early medical attention and treament.\nNeurological scales facilitate stroke recognition at both hospital and pre-hospital levels and provide valuable information of stroke severity. The RACE scale is a prehospital scale validated as a tool to identify patients with suspected large vessel occlusion who are potential candidates for endovascular treatment. \n\nThis course aims to update general knowledge in acute stroke and currently available treatments, to review the protocol\nof the Stroke Code and, finally, to train in the use of the RACE scale.\n\nThe target profile of this course is aimed to all health professionals working in the field of emergencies.",

This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.\n\nNext, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy – M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm’s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience.

The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.\n\nToday, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?\n\nThis course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead “has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.” This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?
