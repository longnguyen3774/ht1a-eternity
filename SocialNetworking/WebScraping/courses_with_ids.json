It is now being offered globally as one of Peking Universityâs MOOCs. \n\nAddressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing studentsâ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding studentsâ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",

For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels â coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important â and sometimes conflicting â drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earthâs environments. \n\nIn this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (ârealitiesâ) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.",

We quickly make connections drawn from our own lives and can fill in other aspects in a story like meaning, emotion, narrative trajectory and so on.\n\nAs the listener, itâs relatively easy to hear a story and imagine, empathize and even come up with possible solutions to alleviate pain. But not so easy when you are the providerâand part of the story itself. Why is that? Why can we do it from a distance, but itâs so difficult to see when we are one of the people in the story?

But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.In this Ableton Certified Training Center course developed by Berklee Online, you will explore some of Liveâs most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not own Ableton Live 10, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30 days. If you use the trial version, do not download it until the course is scheduled to begin.",

    "content": "This course is for activists, artists, and thinkers who wish to better understand and participate in social change. We will focus on the prolific and exciting overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent social movements around the world. Rather than assess the political efficacy of activities like mourning, listening, organizing, dancing, or partying, the lectures examine such cultural activities next to, and within, contemporary art practice.Included in the course are guest presentations by key artists, activists, and scholars, like: Rebecca Gomperts, Chido Govera, Gulf Labor, Hans Haacke, Sharon Hayes, Jolene Rickard, Gregory Sholette, Joshua Wong, and many more. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch and co-taught by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, the course challenges learners to treat the MOOC itself as a social and artistic form. This happens mostly through the practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback.\n\nWhile no prior art making or activist experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.\n\nFor other course offerings or language versions in this series, just search 'ART of the MOOC' inside the Coursera course catalogue.",

    "content": "Sports have become an ever-present reflection of American culture, and an important symbol of the divisions and alliances in our society. Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports.How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space â or doesn't â for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they \"shut up and dribble\"? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. \n\nYour professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today.",

It assumes you have completed the prior courses on \"Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices\" and \"Analytical Mechanics for Spacecraft Dynamics\".  This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.\n\nNext, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

    "content": "Hi and welcome to this course!Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy â M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firmâs long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:\n\n1.Executive Summary: \nThis 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.\n\n2. Student Level:\nThis level involves an understanding of the technical details.  This level requires basic knowledge of concepts in corporate finance, e.g., the time value of money, financial statement analysis, capital structure, and the relation between risk and returns. Learners of this level can skip week 1.\n\n3. Honors Level (honors certificate): \nThis level is challenging, engaging, and compelling to an intellectually rigorous student.",

    "name": "Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges",
    "content": "Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges is a four-week course that explores ethical and societal aspects of the increasing use of artificial intelligent technologies (AI). The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society.The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.\n\nIn the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? \n\nNext, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.\n\nA further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by âconsciousâ? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. \n\nIn the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? \n\nThe last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, \nÂ·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts âintelligenceâ and âconsciousnessâ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness, \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the concepts of âforward-lookingâ and âbackward-looking responsibilityâ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI, \nÂ·      a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem, \nÂ·      and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues.",

Graphs arise in various real-world situations as there are road networks, computer networks and, most recently, social networks! If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work, cheapest way to connect a set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook, you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs.In this online course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms â from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.",

Es un hecho conocido que la mayorÃ­a de altos directivos dedican hasta el 90% de su tiempo al dÃ­a a dÃ­a y menos del 10% a las tareas asociadas al pensamiento estratÃ©gico en la organizaciÃ³n. Por eso es importante ir mÃ¡s allÃ¡ y entender las prioridades que configuran esta actuaciÃ³n diaria.

Estos impactos se podrÃ¡n establecer con las tÃ©cnicas analÃ­ticas de los sistemas de potencia.En este curso queremos brindarle un panorama del anÃ¡lisis de los sistemas elÃ©ctricos de potencia teniendo en cuenta la transiciÃ³n energÃ©tica en la cadena de valor del sector elÃ©ctrico: generaciÃ³n, transmisiÃ³n, distribuciÃ³n y uso final de la energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica. Este panorama te permitirÃ¡ entender los impactos de la transiciÃ³n energÃ©tica en los sistemas de potencia, y la manera como se pueden formalizar desde las tÃ©cnicas de anÃ¡lisis de sistemas de potencia.  \n\nEl curso provee conceptos y tÃ©cnicas de anÃ¡lisis de manera prÃ¡ctica, de fÃ¡cil uso y apropiaciÃ³n, para que se aprenda sobre el rol de los ingenieros de sistemas de potencia que afrontan la transiciÃ³n energÃ©tica, e identifiquen, ademÃ¡s, las oportunidades de formaciÃ³n y desarrollo profesional en el sector energÃ©tico, y, en particular, en la interesante Ã¡rea de los sistemas elÃ©ctricos de potencia.   \n\nAdicionalmente, el curso propone realizar una evaluaciÃ³n al final de cada mÃ³dulo que le permitirÃ¡ revisar los aprendizajes con las realimentaciones registradas en la plataforma, de manera que se pueda continuar progresando al conectarse nuevamente; en el caso de que decida optar por el certificado entregado por la Universidad de los Andes.",

It assumes you have a strong foundation in spacecraft dynamics and control, including particle dynamics, rotating frame, rigid body kinematics and kinetics.  The focus of the course is to understand key analytical mechanics methodologies to develop equations of motion in an algebraically efficient manner.  The course starts by first developing DâAlembertâs principle and how the associated virtual work and virtual displacement concepts allows us to ignore non-working force terms.  Unconstrained systems and holonomic constrains are investigated.  Next Kane's equations and the virtual power form of D'Alembert's equations are briefly reviewed for particles.Next Lagrangeâs equations are developed which still assume a finite set of generalized coordinates, but can be applied to multiple rigid bodies as well.  Lagrange multipliers are employed to apply Pfaffian constraints.  \n\nFinally, Hamiltonâs extended principle is developed to allow us to consider a dynamical system with flexible components.  Here there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom.  The course focuses on how to develop spacecraft related partial differential equations, but does not study numerically solving them.  The course ends comparing the presented assumed mode methods to classical final element solutions.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

If you wish to receive credit for your participation in the course, you will need to complete the full course on the SCCME website at: http://cme.stanford.edu/online. The course version on Coursera does not offer CME credit.\n\nCourse Description\nAntibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence â inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level.",

Anti-Racism II is for anyone who has previously taken Anti-Racism I, or who has basic knowledge of the racial issues plaguing the United States, and globally.Anti-Racism I focused upon how to have open dialogue and conversations about race and racism. Anti-Racism II takes on the vital role assisting students in guiding their own conversations regarding race, and additionally gender and sexuality. Anti-Racism II will expand your knowledge and critically engage your inquiry, centering upon short interviews with leading scholars and activists in the field.   Coupled with supplementary video and reading material, these interviews will further demonstrate the power of open dialogue and self-narration, directing you towards being an anti-racist ally. The centrality of the course interviews will culminate in a final project where students will construct and carry out their own personalized interview. The final project will test dialogic skills while asserting the importance of intimate conversations about race, gender, and sexuality. \n\nThis is challenging work in troubling times that may conjure uneasy feelings and emotions. Anti-Racism II can work as a bridge coming face to face with your personal individual relationship with social demands plaguing us nationally and globally. The remedy is to allow yourself uncomfortableness in order to get to the solutions. We are all in this together.\n\nPeace & Love\nShawn\n\nCourse logo image credit: Emmanuel Gido, 08/31/2020.

Led by expert educators, including Whitney Soule, Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Sean Vereen and Sara Woods, Co-presidents of Heights Philadelphia, this free course will help students, family members, college counselors, and any curious learner to navigate each stage from the start of the college search process through preparing your applications to colleges.This free course includes a variety of videos, readings, and activitiesâall designed to encourage self-reflection, information sharing, and moments of connection.  \n\nIn this course, youâll learn about:â¯ \n\n1. The organizational skills youâll need to be successful in this processâ¯ \n\n2. Important financial aid resources and how to make college affordableâ¯â¯ \n\n3. How to better understand your story and how it connects to what interests you and what colleges look forâ¯ \n\n4. How to find your right college fit \n\n5. The steps and materials needed to complete your college application \n\nThis course is designed for students who are planning to apply to college soon (11th graders and 12th graders), but the activities and videos can still be useful for students who are earlier in their college search journey as they plan for the future. Regardless of where you are in your understanding of the college search processâfrom those who are the first in their family to pursue a bachelorâs degree and who may be trying to figure out where to even beginâto those who are well on their way to preparing an applicationâthis course provides a road map to helping you move through this journey in your own way and on your own time.â¯â¯â¯ \n\nThis course is open to the public, asynchronous, and self-directed without a facilitator. Please note although this course is designed by the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), this is not a course about applying to Penn.  \n\nThe course is also intended for students who may not have access to college counseling â if you attend a school that offers college counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to college.  \n\nThis course is for students who are applying to college for the first time, intending to pursue undergraduate degrees at a four-year institution in the U.S. \n\nIf you are an international student attending a school outside the U.S. interested in learning more about navigating the U.S. university system and application process, we recommend enrolling in this course: Applying to US Universities.",

This third course explores the major aspects of international arbitration as one of the most common method of international dispute settlement . Through this course you will gain an in-depth understanding of the  various facets of international arbitration through the analysis of its role as a mechanism of dispute settlement, its institutions, the fields of law it is applicable to, and, of course, its most famous awards.The main question we will answer together during this course is \"Can international arbitration contribute to the creation of a peaceful world through the settlement of disputes between States and between States and non-State actors?\" In order to do so, we will learn the basic historical concepts or arbitration, as well as everything there is to know about the Permanent Court of Arbitration, based in The Hague. We will then dive into the role of international arbitration in settling disputes relating to the Law of the Sea, with a particular insight into the landmark South China Sea Arbitration. For an entire module, we will focus on investment arbitration, its principles and the procedure of the ICSID, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. We will conclude the course with a module on the interplay between state immunity and enforcement of arbitral awards. This is brought to light through the Yukos Arbitration which is a perfect illustration of the topic.\n\nThis course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into international arbitration, its role and the current issues relating to it. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the principles and rules of arbitration. You will explore the topic through concrete examples and the most prominent arbitrations. You will also grasp the notion of international arbitration navigating between law and politics. International arbitration and The Hague go hand in hand: several key arbitration institutes are located in The Hague and important disputes were settled here through arbitration. The Hague is, so to speak, âthe place to be for international arbitrationâ, especially when we are dealing with arbitration between States, or arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and States. \n\nJoin us for the course and become an expert on international arbitration!\n\nThis course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option. If you want a certificate, but are unable to pay for it, you can request financial aid via Coursera.",

What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization?

This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical questionââHow shall I live?ââand his pupil, Plato, and Platoâs pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.",

AdemÃ¡s, desentraÃ±aremos los misterios de este importante perÃ­odo histÃ³rico y descubriremos cÃ³mo su legado perdura hasta nuestros dÃ­as.Comenzaremos explorando cÃ³mo el cristianismo construyÃ³ el pensamiento medieval y dio forma al arte simbÃ³lico que aÃºn resuena en nuestra sociedad actual. En la siguiente etapa de nuestro viaje, nos adentraremos en la Temprana Edad Media, explorando el arte paleocristiano y las influencias de los pueblos bÃ¡rbaros en la cultura europea. Desde las pinturas en las catacumbas hasta los relieves de los sarcÃ³fagos, cada obra de arte nos cuenta una historia Ãºnica sobre la convergencia de culturas y la evoluciÃ³n del arte en un perÃ­odo de transformaciÃ³n. Mientras tanto en Oriente, recorreremos el momento de oro del Imperio Bizantino con la imponente Santa SofÃ­a. \nPero nuestro viaje no se detiene ahÃ­. Avanzaremos hacia la Alta Edad Media, donde el arte del Imperio Carolingio nos develarÃ¡ que hubo renacimientos antes del Renacimiento. Veremos tambiÃ©n el surgimiento del Sacro Imperio Romano GermÃ¡nico con un arte que se presenta como un antecedente del RomÃ¡nico, un estilo internacional que nos cautivarÃ¡ con su enfoque en la peregrinaciÃ³n y el mundo monÃ¡stico. Examinaremos la iconografÃ­a del Juicio Final y nos sumergiremos en el fascinante mundo de los manuscritos iluminados.\nFinalmente, indagaremos en el arte de la Baja Edad Media y la llegada del arte gÃ³tico, explorando las majestuosas catedrales y los vitrales que aÃºn hoy nos maravillan con su belleza y esplendor. A medida que exploramos las diferencias entre el arte romÃ¡nico y gÃ³tico, tambiÃ©n reflexionaremos sobre cÃ³mo estas formas de expresiÃ³n artÃ­stica reflejan las preocupaciones y aspiraciones de una sociedad en evoluciÃ³n.\nEste curso no solo es un viaje a travÃ©s del tiempo, sino tambiÃ©n una exploraciÃ³n de la belleza, la creatividad y la inspiraciÃ³n que el arte medieval tiene para ofrecer. El objetivo es que, al finalizar el recorrido, puedas tener una conciencia clara de las complejas relaciones entre el arte medieval y la sociedad de la Ã©poca. AdemÃ¡s, serÃ¡s capaz de comprender y construir significados a partir de la iconografÃ­a, aspectos estilÃ­sticos y culturales de las obras de arte medieval.",

Over the past decades, a new figure has emerged that of the art manager.Imagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.\n\t\nThis course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. \n\nLearning Objectives\nThere are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with aÂ quizÂ and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums:Â www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano:Â \nwww.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano):Â eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia):Â www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust:Â www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum:Â www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org/en/list/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence):Â www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino:Â www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles.",

    "content": "More than two decades into the new millennium, it is difficult to envision a future in which digital technologies do not play a significant role. Digital technologies frequently make a lot of promises. However, in recent years, we have seen an increasing number of artists address fundamental issues of the Digital Transformation, such as surveillance, lack of representation, and digital illiteracy. Artists have demonstrated that, while digital technologies have the potential to support processes leading to greater equality, they are frequently viewed as perpetuating and even exacerbating inequalities.This course is primarily aimed at changemakers who want to build a better digital future with the help of the arts.\n\nThis course will teach you how the arts can influence technology development through art and enterprise collaborations; how the arts can assist citizens and civil society in making sense of and overcoming the challenges brought on by the Digital Transformation; and how the arts can influence the processes of regulation, policy-making, and legislation within the Digital Transformation. The course also provides insights into arts organisation, reflecting on issues of funding and community building that many engaged artists face. Building on theoretical concepts, questions about the arts and technology will be elaborated and explored through conversations with brilliant artists, makers, curators, and others working at the intersection of the arts and technology, who will generously share their knowledge and experiences with us.\n\nIf you are an artist or an organisation interested in learning more about the power of the arts to influence digital transformation, this is the place to start. This course will provide you with the foundation and inspiration to begin or continue work on investigating, promoting, and facilitating more equal, inclusive, and democratic digital futures.

    "content": "For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by âbig dataâ including data persistency and student profiling.--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nRelated Resources\n--------------------------------\n\nOnline resources are available here:\nhttps://newlearningonline.com\n\n--------------------------------\nJoin our Online Communities!\n--------------------------------\n\nCGScholar (Create an account and join the New Learning community)\nhttps://cgscholar.com/community/community_profiles/new-learning/community_updates\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/newlearningonline\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/neolearning\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the Assessment for Learning course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions.

Therefore, it is essential for data scientists to develop the skills in producing and critically interpreting digital maps, charts, and graphs. Data visualization is an increasingly important topic in our globalized and digital society. It involves graphically representing data or information, enabling decision-makers across various industries to comprehend complex concepts and processes that may otherwise be challenging to grasp. DSCI 605 Data visualization serves as the foundation for understanding principles, concepts, techniques, and tools used to visualize information in large, intricate data sets. It also provides hands-on experience in visualizing big data using the open-source software R. Through the course, students will learn to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization designs and think critically about decisions, such as color choice and visual encoding. Additionally, students will create their own data visualizations and become proficient in using R.The course comprises four sections. The first section caters to learners with minimal or no experience in R, establishing the groundwork for data visualization with R. The second section introduces preliminary data visualization techniques, allowing students to gain hands-on experience with common visualization practices for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using ggplot2. This section emphasizes data exploration before delving into advanced data mining. The third section builds upon existing data visualization skills by delving into advanced data visualization topics, including interactive data visualization, time series plotting, and spatial mapping.   \n\nThe primary objective of the first three sections is to equip students with a well-developed set of skills, enabling them to create a wide range of visualizations in R. The final section focuses on completing a final project, where students apply the skills, theory, and experiences gained from the previous sections. The project entails developing a data visualization that effectively communicates a compelling story to the audience and readers.",

The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students interested in tackling all facets of optimization applications. You will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest. This will allow you to unlock the power of industrial solving technologies, which have been perfected over decades by hundreds of PhD researchers.

    "content": "The coordination of life in multicellular organisms is precisely controlled by cells via various internal and external signals. Cells depend on different types of signals to regulate their growth, division, metabolism as well as death. Signals are growth factors or hormones produced and secreted by other cells. Some signals such as nutrients are in the form of molecules from the environment. Signaling molecules are sensed by direct binding to specific receptor molecules. Depending on the biochemical properties and ways of molecules changes, we can group various signaling events in defined pathways. Throughout specific signal transduction pathways, a signal can modulate cellular activities and gene expression, thereby leading to changes in cell growth, metabolism, differentiation, or many other cellular functions. When genetic mutations or biochemical changes occur in key proteins of certain cellular signaling pathways, cellular homeostasis can be disrupted, thus triggering tissue malfunctions, itiation or spread of cancer, or developmental anomalies. Dissecting biochemical principles of these cell signaling pathways is essential for us to better understand mechanisms of both normal cells and pathological conditions, therefore our knowledge on signal transduction will provide valuable information to develop effective therapeutic agents to fight against diseases..This 6 week-course will give you a solid introduction to the basic fundamentals of cell signaling. I will first define the concept of cell signaling and introduces major types of cellular signaling events. Throughout 6 weeks, we will study biochemical basis of electrical signaling, chemical signaling as well as gap junction-mediated signaling pathways. We will also learn about key principles underlying signal transduction pathways by studying significance of protein-protein interactions and signaling second messengers. In the end of each week, dysregulated cell signaling in pathological conditions such as cancer and diabetes will be presented and discussed. Everyone knows that cell signaling is essential for sustaining life. How can you explain insulin actions in lowering glucose in biochemical details? What can be the fundamental mode of oxygen sensing in our body? Have you ever thought about ways of how we can specifically remove or kill certain types of rapidly-growing cancer cells? Cell signaling accompanies various biochemical strategies to sense and transmit signals inside our cells. Without fine control of those signaling processes, cells, tissues, and organisms cannot maintain life.",

    "content": "More than one century after the Wright brothers' first flight, the flight still defy our intuition. You will learn here how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry. For that, we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplane's movement and attitude in space, and a refresher on basic general mechanic principles. You will remind how Newton's 2nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple - or on an airplane, to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed. Coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy, you will discover the very useful concept of total height and you will be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude, while changes in total height are much slower.In the end, you will discover that only a very small number of forces apply on an airplane in flight and that you will be able to classify those that change its energy state and those that modify its trajectory. You will discover the concept of load factor and understand why the pilot of a combat aircraft can feel a weight nine-time greater than his actual weight! Finally, we will establish the lift and propulsion equations, that form the basis of flight mechanics, and you will be able to compute the lift and thrust necessary to follow a given trajectory at a given speed.\n\nThis course is for anybody interested in learning more about how planes work, the physics of flying, or flight mechanics. It will be of particular interest to undergraduate students in aerospace engineering, trainees as well as senior pilots, journalists, and professionals in the aeronautics sector.\n\nAlthough some mathematical formalism may be present sometimes. It is always doubled by sketches, figures, and hands-explanations. So that, anybody can skip the formulas without losing the core understanding of the concepts.\n\nNo apples were harmed in the making of this course...\n\nThis course is only a foretaste of the mechanics of flight. ISAE-SUPAERO and Eric Poquillon will offer you other courses and the first specialization in autumn 2021. Initially, three courses will be published to answer several questions: Can we fly as high as we want? What is a stall? Why do some planes have propellers and others have jet engines? Is an airplane always stable? How do you control an airplane following an engine failure? All this and more will be covered in this series of flight mechanics courses.\n\nThis course is a part of the specialization \"Fundamentals of Flight mechanics\".",

    "content": "Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethovenâs music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethovenâs music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethovenâs music itself. \n\nThis season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson. \n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis's lifelong learning initiatives.",

Through short video lectures, practitioner interviews and a wide range of interactive activities, learners will be immersed in the world of public health practice.Designed for those new to the discipline, over three modules (intended for three weeks of learning), learners will become familiar with the scope, theory and implementation of behaviour change in the context of public health practice. The course begins by challenging learners about their preconceptions about healthy and unhealthy behaviour - seeking to contextualise these ideas within the broader public health approach (the first course of this specialisation). The course thereafter swiftly covers the origins of risk communication and behaviour change through the lens of health psychology and classical economics, before introducing ideas of bounded rationality and the genesis of behavioural insights and so-called Nudges. By the end of the course, learners will be fluent with their use of the Behaviour Change Wheel methodology of intervention development and the application of the COM-B framework to a range of target behaviours and behavioural barriers.\n\nThe subsequent courses of this specialisation will cover health protection before moving into the final (degree learner) course which where learners will focus on developing the core professional skillset that defines public health practitioners - whether in service or academia.",

This course, âBeyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,â is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrackÂ® Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity.Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, weâll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the worldâs most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.\n\nThroughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nationsâ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.\n\nIn this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n1. Understand and explain the worldâs most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty & inequality, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change.\n2. Critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationship to the worldâs most pressing problems.\n3. Use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.\n4. Assess relevant solutions that would help realize the SDGs and at the same time solve the pressing problems. \n5. Apply skills learned to implement solutions.",

    "content": "With its walls razed to ground by Babylonâs armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished citiesâfrom Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanityâs greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authorsâ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.",

TambiÃ©n les apoyamos en el desarrollo de  habilidades para usar ese marco de referencia en la vida cotidiana. \n\nSi te animas a tomar este curso, te aseguramos que al final vas a contar con una gran variedad de herramientas que puedes usar en el medio en el que vives, estudias o trabajas Â¡te esperamos!",

More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum. I will present evidence behind these startling discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.This course is offered in English.",

With more than 99% of all mediated information in digital format and with 98% of the world population using digital technology, humanity produces an impressive digital footprint. In theory, this provides unprecedented opportunities to understand and shape society. In practice, the only way this information deluge can be processed is through using the same digital technologies that produced it. Data is the fuel, but machine learning it the motor to extract remarkable new knowledge from vasts amounts of data. Since an important part of this data is about ourselves, using algorithms in order to learn more about ourselves naturally leads to ethical questions. Therefore, we cannot finish this course without also talking about research ethics and about some of the old and new lines computational social scientists have to keep in mind. As hands-on labs, you will use IBM Watsonâs artificial intelligence to extract the personality of people from their digital text traces, and you will experience the power and limitations of machine learning by teaching two teachable machines from Google yourself.",

O sono Ã© essencial a vida, nÃ£o dormir bem gera como consequÃªncia uma vida de mÃ¡ qualidade, no entanto hÃ¡ pouca informaÃ§Ã£o sobre esse tema circulando. Culturalmente tende-se anegligenciar o sono e hipervalorizar o trabalho. Pretendemos, neste curso, informar como o sono estÃ¡ ligado a saÃºde e ao bem estar do indivÃ­duo, queremos que nosso aluno use essa informaÃ§Ã£o para pensar o prÃ³prio sono e daqueles que estÃ£o ao seu redor. Este Ã© um curso introdutÃ³rio que abordarÃ¡ questÃµes relacionadas ao sono como: os momentos histÃ³ricos e os personagens que fizeram do sono objeto da ciÃªncia, a evoluÃ§Ã£o biolÃ³gica do sono, como o sono se apresenta em diferentes espÃ©cies, se ele acontece em todos os seres vivos. Veremos como se dÃ¡ o sono do ponto de vista do funcionamento do cÃ©rebro e como ele muda ao longo da vida. Vamos estudar os fatores no corpo e no ambiente que determinam a hora e por quanto tempo dormimos. Abordaremos um pouco da Medicina do Sono e falaremos das principias doenÃ§as de sono descritas, como a insÃ´nia e a apneia do sono e sobre outros distÃºrbios de sono menos comuns, exploraremos como se fazem os tratamentos e o diagnÃ³stico dessas doenÃ§as  que afetam tantas pessoas em todo o mundo.  O curso Ã© voltado a alunos do campos de licenciatura, pedagogia, da saÃºde e professores da rede municipal de ensino  estadual de ensino.

The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals.The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along \"moments-that-matter\" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.\n\nYou will learn and practice the following skills:\n\n1.\tHow to build brands from a broad organisational perspective \n2.\tHow to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome) \n3.\tHow to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies\n4.\tHow to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally\n5.\tHow to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets. \n\nThis course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:\n\n1.\tHead. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today\n2.\tHeart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands â regardless of where you are in your organisation â thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation\n3.\tHands.

This short course will equip you with a solid grasp of how agency relationships workâincluding how to spot legal risks when they go sideways. You'll get hands-on with real-world business structures, learning when it makes sense to form an LLC versus a partnership, and how to avoid those dreaded partnership disputes. Plus, you'll navigate the world of corporationsâfrom incorporation to boardroom accountabilityâso you can confidently support clients through business growth, governance, and even mergers.This course is designed as an introductory overview and not a âone-stop shopâ for in-depth legal education. Understanding each aspect of these specialized areasâwould require much more time and study.\nEach lesson has a reading assignment, case scenarios (practice assessments) and a graded quiz. These activities will help you reinforce what you have learned.  \nThe course will require you to practice basic legal writing and analytical skills that you apply towards case scenario assignments to strengthen your case analysis skills.\n Remember to monitor business law trends as the business laws presented in this course are likely to change over time.",

    "content": "This is the last of the three courses part of the Globalization, Economic Growth and Stability Specialization.Â¨Business Opportunities and Risks in a Globalized WorldÂ¨ is the the 3rd and final course of the Â¨Globalization, Economic Growth and StabilityÂ¨ Specialization taught by IE Business School's Professor Gayle Allard. This course is designed to help an investor, businessperson or economist approach macroeconomic, institutional and international data and derive information from the indicators that point to the types of opportunities and risks that they present.  Students will gain practice by handling the data of some of the largest economies in the world âthe United States, Japan, the European Union, China and Indiaâand âreading the storyâ of their economies from their data, yielding surprisingly profound conclusions about their present and future. The course is the third in a series for the specialization but it is also a stand-alone course for anyone who wants practice in practical macroeconomics.This course includes 4 modules, each one deep-diving into the macroeconomic circumstances that have been brought up in the recent history of four key regions: the USA, Japan, Europe, and China and India.  Students will analyze the ways in which international economies relate with one another, the benefits of trade and migration and economic development and how it occurs, among other themes.  \n\nProfessor Allard takes overarching macroeconomic theory and turns it into a practical tool for those interested in the opportunities and risks of investment and doing business in each of the four regions covered.",

    "content": "Welcome Course 3 - The Business, Politics, Policy, & Players of Space Programs.  If you are here, you have successfully completed both Course 1 and 2 of this specialization. Course 3 has nine lessons spread out over 4 weeks with 31 Learning Objectives. In this course, we will discover who and what funds the exploration that we have enjoyed learning about in Course 1 and 2. We will also focus on a few specific applications of some of the concepts we have learned about so far with two companies, the Global Positioning System, and the an academic program that could be implemented at your institution of higher learning.Week 1 - There are three lessons this week that will cover a range of topics that greatly influence where space exploration has been, is today, and will go. The Politics of Space, with Jack Waldorf and Abby Benson will provide a basic overview of how space missions are funded in the US government. Space Governance with Dr. Zach Donohew and Eric Alston, JD will present the case and justification for how we as species will need to govern what we do in space. The Business of Space with Dr. Dan Baker, will cover the basics of the space industry from the size to the value of doing business in space. These topics will build on many of the others we have covered in the other courses and in the lessons ahead.\n\nWeek 2 - This week's topic is Space Entrepreneurship and it is broken it into two parts. Both parts involve real-world space entrepreneurs. Part 1 is with Dr. James Stuart who has started many space companies and continues to work with other entrepreneurs as they push the boundary of what we do in space. Part 2 is with Scott Tibbitts, who has a very unique background and path to being a space entrepreneur but that did not stop him and his company from enabling NASA to explore Mars. These lessons will give you a new perspective on the impact entrepreneurs have in space exploration.\n\nWeek 3 and Week 4 are application lessons where we take a deep dive into a few of the many examples where space is used in our daily lives and how companies and academic programs are helping to bring access to space to everyone. The Global Positioning System (GPS), with Dr. Penny Axelrad, is so ingrained in our daily lives that we may not even realize we are using it. We will discuss how it came to be and how it will be used for years to come. David Ferguson and I will discuss SpaceX's Starship and Starlink programs and how one company is changing our vision for how we explore and use space. The Access to Space for All with Sierra Space, with Dr. Janet Kavandi, covers how one company, that many may not have heard of, has big plans for science and tourism in space. Dr. Kavandi also has some interesting space experience! The last lesson of this course covers an academic program at the University of Colorado Boulder call the Space Minor. Ashleigh Bailey and I discuss this unique program that allows students of all majors to minor in space. This program is a model of other institutions of higher education around the world. \n\nSo please consider enrolling and then let's hit the trail.",

For example, have you thought that there should be an easier way to read your bill or pay your bill? Or do you work in a healthcare organization and find yourself thinking that there must be better ways for the business processes to function?  If you have, this course is for you.Course content includes an overview of healthcare organization business processes including business process management approaches as well as a discussion of healthcare organization entrepreneurship as a business process. The course provides links to external sites to connect you to the larger \"real world\" of healthcare organization business processes, business process management, and entrepreneurship. The links also serve as resources you can take with you after you complete the course experience. And because everyone loves a road trip/field trip, there are also \"virtual field trips\" to the often hidden places of interest on the web. \n\nThe course format is readings, videos, quizzes, and a project.  The project requires you to synthesize course material to design patient-centered business processes for a healthcare organization the way you would have things run in the best of all worlds. The design (submitted as an electronic word processing document in memo format) is an artifact of the course which you can circulate to colleagues or use as the basis for a talk or presentation event.",

    "content": "Los cursos de CÃ¡lculo Diferencial y CÃ¡lculo Integral tradicionalmente se ofrecen separados y respetando ese orden. El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo, la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental del CÃ¡lculo (TFC) para establecer la relaciÃ³n entre ambos conceptos. En el presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio.Vamos a iniciar con la interpretaciÃ³n del Teorema Fundamental del CÃ¡lculo, con esto nos referimos a descubrir su significado real en la soluciÃ³n de problemas. Llegaremos a asociar con Ã©l la actividad prÃ¡ctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud que estÃ¡ cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretaciÃ³n, los conceptos de derivada e integral se verÃ¡n relacionados desde un principio, lo que te permitirÃ¡ predecir el valor de una magnitud que estÃ¡ cambiando. Las nociones fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de ârazÃ³n de cambioâ y de âacumulaciÃ³n del cambioâ, y el TFC nos proveerÃ¡ de la estrategia de soluciÃ³n.\n \nRecordarÃ¡s que la MatemÃ¡tica Elemental incluye el Ãlgebra, la GeometrÃ­a y la GeometrÃ­a AnalÃ­tica. Podemos decir que Ã©stas son MatemÃ¡ticas que estudian lo estÃ¡tico. En cambio, la MatemÃ¡tica Superior, que incluye el CÃ¡lculo, estudia lo dinÃ¡mico. Con el CÃ¡lculo se inicia el estudio del cambio, una realidad presente en nuestro entorno cotidiano sin duda alguna. Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energÃ­as, capitales de inversiÃ³n, longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrÃ¡s entender al CÃ¡lculo como una estrategia de soluciÃ³n para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo de las MatemÃ¡ticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante informaciÃ³n.\n \nAl finalizar este curso podrÃ¡s:\n\nDescribir de quÃ© manera los modelos matemÃ¡ticos polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonomÃ©tricos (seno y coseno), son una construcciÃ³n que responde a esta prÃ¡ctica de predicciÃ³n. Los verÃ¡s a todos ellos surgir de esta prÃ¡ctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas condiciones en su ârazÃ³n de cambioâ con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende. \n\nUtilizar la introducciÃ³n de procesos infinitos (Â¡no imposibles!) en la construcciÃ³n de la respuesta de predicciÃ³n, con ello entenderÃ¡s por quÃ© se habla de MatemÃ¡tica Superior y de un pensamiento matemÃ¡tico avanzado.\n\nValorar una forma de pensar diferente, donde nuestro razonamiento matemÃ¡tico trascienda la sola manipulaciÃ³n de fÃ³rmulas algebraicas.",

This notion of accumulation can be applied to different quantities, including money, populations, weight, area, volume, and air pollutants.  The concepts in this course apply to many other disciplines outside of traditional mathematics.\n\nWe will expand the notion of the average value of a data set to allow for infinite values, develop the formula for arclength and curvature, and derive formulas for velocity, acceleration, and areas between curves.

La dÃ©marche proposÃ©e se veut critique, il ne sâagit ni de canoniser ni de condamner Calvin, mais de comprendre sa pensÃ©e avec toute la distance requise et dâen analyser les enjeux.\n\nAu cours de la premiÃ¨re semaine, nous explorerons les principales Ã©tapes de la vie de Calvin. Les semaines 2 et 3 seront consacrÃ©es Ã  lâÃ©tude de sa pensÃ©e thÃ©ologique et de son Ã©thique. Enfin, lors des semaines 4 et 5, nous nous interrogerons sur la diffusion du calvinisme dans le monde et la pertinence actuelle de la pensÃ©e de Calvin.\n\n--\nThis course is an introduction to the life and thought of the reformer John Calvin (1509-1564) and to his influence on the modern and contemporary world. The approach we develop is critical:  we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.\n\nDuring five weeks, we will explore together the life and work of the Reformer. During the first week, we will study the main aspects of Calvinâs life. Weeks 2 and 3 will focus on his theology and his ethics. During the last two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), we will ponder how Calvinism became a worldwide phenomenon and ask ourselves what kind of relevance Calvinâs thought may still have today.",

    "content": "The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance.Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\n\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \n\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\n\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

This course presents a capstone design challenge where you get to develop, simulate and study how to approach a tumbling debris object.  The servicer starts from far away and carefully does a series of maneuver to get closer and closer in a safe manner.  As the debris object is tumbling, the servicer will have to account for relative attitude motion as well.  The final approach is in a debris body-fixed manner illustrating a case of controlling non-Keplerian motion.After this course, you will be able to...\n\n* Design safe approach trajectories\n* Implement relative motion feedback control solutions\n* Model the relative motion and relative attitude in the LVLH frame\n* Implement non-Keplerian reference motion\n\nPlease note: this is an advanced course, best suited for working engineers or students with college-level knowledge in mathematics and physics.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society?

This course examines how the organization of care has changed in modern times and the dilemmas those developments pose to helping professionals. Among the questions it engages are: How does the meaning of care change when it is performed outside the family? Do bureaucratic systems discourage individuals from taking responsibility for othersâ suffering? How do care professionals manage their emotions and those of their clients?  Can and should care work be rehumanized? In addition to helping learners develop informed responses to these pressing issues, The Challenges of Modern Caregiving will give students the chance to learn a method that identifies gaps in existing care systems.",

    "content": "The aim of this course is to promote critical thinking with regard to forensic science. Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course â given by specialists in the field â goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.Â  It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice. Some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.******************\nSpecial thanks to our translators, in particular the University of Lausanne and the School of Criminal Justice sincerely thank Massimiliano Stabile (forensic biologist), Francesco Zampa (forensic chemist) and Giampietro Lago (forensic biologist) for the Italian translation of the course.",

    "content": "Chemical biology is a burgeoning field that has rapidly risen to prominence. This surge of interest has been fuelled by chemical biologyâs applicability to understanding critical processes in live cells or model organisms in real time. This success has arisen because chemical biology straddles a nexus between chemistry, biology, and physics. Thus, chemical biology can harness rapid chemistry to observe or perturb biological processes, that are in turn reported using physical assays, all in an otherwise unperturbed living entity.Although its boundaries are endless, the multidisciplinary nature of chemical biology can make the field seem daunting; we beg to differ! Here, we deconstruct chemical biology into its core components, and repackage the material. In the process we build up for each student a practical and theoretical knowledge bank that will set these students on their way to understanding and designing their own chemical biology experiments. \n\nWe will discuss fluorescence as a general language used to read out biological phenomena as diverse as protein localization, membrane tension, surface phenomena, and enzyme activity. We will proceed to discuss protein labeling strategies and fusion protein design. Then we will discuss larger and larger scale chemical biology mechanism and screening efforts. Highlights include a large amount of new data, tailored in the lab videos, and a large number of skilled presenters.",

You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.In order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.\n\nTo illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University. These scientists will give a look in their field of knowledge and their collaboration with colleagues, to illustrate how the theory you will learn translates to practice.\n\nIn sum, we invite you to follow us on a journey to understand child development from synapse to society!",

    "content": "One of the most significant changes in the world in the past 30 years is the opening of China to the outside world and its engagement with that world. In the initial years of the opening, external forces influenced Chinaâs economy, regional balances, bureaucracy, as well as the political authority of local leaders in the coastal areas. More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected Chinaâs internal development. We then look at various aspects of Chinaâs âgoing out strategyâ â its search for energy, talent, as well as its relations with the United States and the states within the Asia-Pacific region. The instructor has been deeply engaged in research on all these topics, having lived in China during various stages of Chinaâs opening to the outside world.Course Overview video: https://youtu.be/7FpNL67EbE4",

    "content": "This course offers a conceptual framework for understanding China that highlights the intersection of politics and economics. It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a âpoliticalâ economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leadersâ decisions. Finally, we assess Chinaâs future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese Politics Part 2 â China and the World.Course Overview video: https://youtu.be/7FpNL67EbE4",

He examines the meaning and significance of four key virtuesâkindness, hope, humility, and generosityâand their importance to living a good life. \n\nFurther, you will consider the practical aspects of living a virtuous life. We will discuss the challenges to living the virtues, and examine how they can be cultivated by incorporating contemplative practices in your everyday life. \n\nWeek 1 draws on baptism as our initiation into a new story and way of being in the world. In Week 1, you will explore the virtue of kindness through the character of God, reflected in how we treat ourselves and others. Week 2 focuses on hope. In Week 3, you will explore the virtue of humility, and reflecting on the paradox that trying to be humble often ends in pride. Finally, Week 4 closes with an exploration of generosity, demonstrating how different virtues reveal the God who is unrelentingly generous.",

    "content": "La ciencia de datos puede entenderse como la aplicaciÃ³n del potencial de la ciencia de datos en la bÃºsqueda de soluciones novedosas a problemas del sector energÃ©tico. Este curso busca facilitar la comprensiÃ³n de cÃ³mo es ese proceso y, para ello, se enfoca exclusivamente en el subsector de la energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica.Para desarrollar un proyecto de ciencia de datos energÃ©ticos se necesita que confluyan dos tipos de conocimiento: por una parte, un conocimiento sobre el sector elÃ©ctrico (cÃ³mo es su estructura, cuÃ¡les son sus principales retos, cÃ³mo funciona) y , por otra, un conocimiento sobre la ciencia de datos (cuÃ¡les son sus fundamentos, cÃ³mo opera, quÃ© tipo de aportes puede dar). Por esa razÃ³n, es usual que se constituyan equipos interdisciplinarios en los que confluyen tanto expertos en energÃ­a como expertos en anÃ¡lisis de datos. \n\nNo es fÃ¡cil para estos expertos poder dialogar, porque el conocimiento especializado suele tener tambiÃ©n un lenguaje especializado y no es fÃ¡cil compartir la experticia con personas que no son especialistas en nuestro campo de conocimiento. \n\nJustamente, este curso busca ayudar a facilitar ese diÃ¡logo y a sobrepasar esas barreras de comunicaciÃ³n. \n\nPara ello, lo que haremos serÃ¡ presentar los elementos bÃ¡sicos, fundamentales de cada una de las dos Ã¡reas del conocimiento con una perspectiva mÃ¡s amplia que profunda. El propÃ³sito es el de adquirir una comprensiÃ³n de alto nivel de tanto los elementos del sector elÃ©ctrico como de la ciencia de datos. Aspiramos que, al finalizar exitosamente este curso, usted pueda entender y explicar cÃ³mo funciona el proceso de ciencia de datos aplicado a los problemas del sector elÃ©ctrico.\n\nÂ¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡ estructurado el curso? El curso tiene seis mÃ³dulos y en cada uno de esos mÃ³dulos trabajamos un tema del Ã¡rea de energÃ­a y un tema del Ã¡rea de ciencia de datos, que confluyen en una aplicaciÃ³n concreta o, al menos, en una etapa de una aplicaciÃ³n concreta. En cada mÃ³dulo, usted encontrarÃ¡:\n- videos explicativos\n- un laboratorio no calificado\n- un laboratorio calificado\n- un cuestionario calificado.\n\nLos laboratorios son espacios para desarrollar tareas en lenguaje Python. No esperamos que usted sea un experto desarrollador de programas en Python, pero sÃ­ que tenga algÃºn tipo de experticia en programaciÃ³n. \n\nÂ¿Para quiÃ©n es este curso? Hemos imaginado este curso teniendo en mente dos posibles perfiles:\n1) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos sobre el sector energÃ©tico que quiere explorar quÃ© puede aprovechar de la ciencia de datos; y\n2) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos en ciencia de datos que quiere explorar cÃ³mo puede aportar esos conocimientos en el Ã¡rea del sector energÃ©tico. Por ej.: Este curso estÃ¡ dedicado principalmente a estudiantes universitarios de primer y segundo aÃ±o interesados en ciencia e ingenierÃ­a, junto con estudiantes de secundaria y profesionales interesados en programaciÃ³n.",

This is the aim of the Circular Economy, but it doesnât happen on its own. It is the result of choices and strategies by suppliers, designers, businesses, policymakers and all of us as consumers.In addition to providing many cases of managing materials for sustainability, the course also teaches skills and tools for analyzing circular business models and promotes development of your own ideas to become more involved in the transition to a Circular Economy.\n\nYou will learn from expert researchers and practitioners from around Europe as they explain core elements and challenges in the transition to a circular economy over the course of 5 modules:\n\nModule 1: Materials. This module explores where materials come from, and builds a rationale for why society needs more circularity. \n\nModule 2: Circular Business Models. In this module circular business models are explored in-depth and a range of ways for business to create economic and social value are discussed.\n\nModule 3: Circular Design, Innovation and Assessment.

    "content": "Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  \n\nThis course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.",

    "content": "Circular Product Design Frameworks and Certifications is the third and final course of the Circular Product Development for the Circular Economy specialization.  The aim of this course is to explore different circular design frameworks such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's collaboration with IDEO to create a Circular Product Design Guide, the partnership between industry and research teams that culminated in the CIRCit Guide to Circular Product Design and Development, and Biomimicry 3.8's Guide to best practices. If the first two courses in the specialization describe what circular product and packaging design is and what it can achieve, this course is about the processes and methodologies necessary to make it happen.The course begins by examining the motivation for circular product design, highlighting what is happening at major corporations such as IKEA, as well as for regulatory mandates, such as the European Union's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (the ESPR). The course then dives into the Ellen MacArthur Foundation-IDEO's 4-Phase Design Guide based on human-centered design and design thinking. The Circular Product Design approach defined by the CIRCit Project is also examined in detail, as it dovetails nicely into existing stage-gate product development processes. The course then briefly discusses biomimicry as an innovative way to emulate nature's solutions to today's challenges. Increasingly, consumers (and investors!) are interested in more sustainable and circular products, and one way of demonstrating a company's success is with a 3rd party certification. Therefore, the course wraps up with a focus on the Cradle-to-Cradle Products Innovation Instituteâs certification process. Included in this course is a comprehensive set of tools, worksheets, and activities that can be used by any product design team interested in developing circular products that benefit both people and the environment.\n\nThis course was developed in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of the \"Design for the Circular Economy\" collection. Learners who complete and pass the course can receive an industry-recognized digital badge.\n\nThe âDesign for the Circular Economyâ microcredential and graduate certificate are developed around the educational goals of providing technical, business, and leadership knowledge and skills that inspire the transformation towards a more circular economy. This includes gaining technical knowledge to apply circular economy principles in product design, minimizing waste and maximizing impact; developing business acumen to implement innovative circular economic models that prioritize sustainability and resilience; and acquiring leadership strategies to communicate effectively and inspire change within an organization. \n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulderâs Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the ME-EM is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience.

Each week we will tackle aspects of the Rule of Law and discuss how they are impacted by current events. The course will use video lectures, recommended reading, discussion questions and activities to enable you to develop your own perspective on the Rule of Law. Though this course sits at the intersection of law and politics, participants do not require any formal educational background in either of these subjects to join.

I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to your contributions to the other learners in our community.This course will provide the knowledge and  the tools needed to understand what cities do, why they matter, the forces shaping the greatest wave of urbanization in history, and how to pick the right place for you. The course will also help you develop critical thinking skills. We'll accomplish this by providing evidence of the importance of cities, and why and how they matter to you. Then weâll ask you to apply what youâve learned in an exercise which will help you assess your own community and find your best place.\n\n This course is accessible and open to anyone who is interested in learning more about cities and the ways they affect our lives. It is organized around five key modules: (1) Why Cities Matter,  (2) A World of Cities,  (3) The Creative City, (4) The Divided City and the New Urban Crisis, and (5) How to Find the Best Place for You.\n\n After completing the course, you will be able to:\n\n\n(1) Identify why cities are the drivers of economic prosperity;\n(2) Explain the drivers and implications of fast-growing urbanization worldwide;\n(3) Outline the key characteristics of a creative and innovative city;\n(4) Describe the social divides and challenges facing cities and the solutions cities are using to address them; and\n(5) Recognize the trade-offs of staying in your current city versus moving, and identify the best place for you and your family to live.\n\nOf course the world has changed a great deal since I developed this course. The Global COVID-19 Pandemic is affecting cities, businesses and people around the world. It is something I have been writing about and working with mayors, city managers, economic developers, urban leaders and communities across the globe. I have put together a new module on Cities and the Coronavirus to help you better understand the ways in which the Covid-19 crisis is impacting cities and how you can best understand  and deal with that.\n\nIâd like to wish each and every one of you good luck as you get started on this journey. I hope you enjoy the course!",
